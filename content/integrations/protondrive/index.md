# Plakar + Proton Drive: Immutable, Encrypted Backups for Your Private Cloud

Proton Drive is privacy-first, but sync alone can’t protect you from:

- ❌ Accidental deletions or overwrites
- 🦠 Malware or ransomware
- 🔓 Lost credentials or locked accounts

🔐 Plakar makes your Proton Drive data immutable, encrypted, and rollback-ready, by design.

Because resilience isn’t a feature. It’s a mindset.

## 🧠 What is Proton Drive?

Proton Drive is Proton’s secure, end-to-end encrypted cloud storage service. It keeps sensitive files safe from prying eyes, but like any sync service, it can’t always undo accidents or attacks.

## 🚨 Why Proton Drive Needs Backup (Even With Sync)

>Sync ≠ backup. It can spread mistakes, not protect against them.

Encryption protects privacy — but what about:

- Accidental deletion across synced devices
- Ransomware or malware overwriting your originals
- Restoring a file exactly as it was, months ago

🎯 Plakar fills the gap with encrypted, versioned snapshots you control — stored where you decide.

## 🛡️ How Plakar Protects Your Proton Drive

Plakar securely **imports** your Proton Drive files, encrypts and deduplicates them locally, then **stores** versioned snapshots in your Plakar repository (called a *Kloset*). You can even **store your Plakar backups on Proton Drive** for additional redundancy, or export them back when needed.

| **Risk**                        | **How Plakar Helps**                                              |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ❌ Accidental deletion           | Restore files or folders back to Proton Drive anytime               |
| 🦠 Malware or ransomware         | Immutable, encrypted snapshots protect clean versions               |
| 🔓 Account compromise            | Zero-trust design — Plakar’s encryption stays in your hands         |
| 📂 Limited versioning            | Plakar keeps full history with deduplication                        |
| 🔄 Storage flexibility           | Store Plakar snapshots on Proton Drive or another secure backend    |

## ⚠️ What Proton Drive Sync Doesn’t Cover

Proton Drive’s sync and trash features don’t protect you from:

- Permanent deletion after trash expiry
- Ransomware or mass overwrite
- Account lockout or suspension
- Audit and compliance needs

Plakar snapshots are immutable, encrypted, and stored where you choose—giving you true control.

## ✅ Common Use Cases

- Import Proton Drive files into an encrypted Plakar repository
- Store versioned backups **on Proton Drive** for easy access
- Export clean data back to Proton Drive after loss or corruption
- Keep an immutable offline copy for peace of mind
- Migrate Proton Drive content securely

## 📊 Integration Details

| **Property**         | **Value**                           |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Category             | Cloud Storage                       |
| Supported Methods    | CLI / Agent / Web UI                |
| Protocols            | Proton Drive API, HTTPS             |
| Encryption Model     | Local key derivation, zero-trust    |

## 🗺️ How It Works (At a Glance)

```
Proton Drive ⇄ Plakar Agent ⇄ Encrypted, Deduplicated Snapshots ⇄ Proton Drive or Other Storage
```

Files flow securely in, get chunked and double-encrypted, then stored wherever you decide.

## 🔄 TL;DR: Backups You Control

Plakar + Proton Drive gives you:

✅ Snapshots with rollback and metadata
✅ Encryption at the chunk level
✅ Support for any topology
✅ Zero-trust backup flows
✅ Visual inspection and audit readiness
✅ No cloud vendor lock-in
