# Plakar + Proton Drive: Double Down on Privacy for Your Files

Proton Drive encrypts your files end-to-end — but what if you need versioned backups, easy restores, or off-site redundancy?

Sync alone can’t protect you from:

- ❌ Accidental deletions or overwrites
- 🦠 Malware that locks or corrupts files
- 🔓 Lost credentials or locked accounts

🔐 **Plakar lets you import, store, and export your Proton Drive files as encrypted, versioned snapshots you control — without sacrificing Proton’s privacy-first promise.**

Because real privacy means having a backup plan.

> 👉 Get started with the [setup guide](docs/main/integrations/proton-drive/)

## 🧠 What is Proton Drive?

Proton Drive is Proton’s secure, end-to-end encrypted cloud storage service. It keeps sensitive files safe from prying eyes, but like any sync service, it can’t always undo accidents or attacks.

## 🚨 Why Proton Drive Needs Versioned Backups

Encryption protects privacy — but what about:

- Accidental deletion across synced devices
- A ransomware attack that overwrites your originals
- Restoring a file exactly as it was, months ago

🎯 Plakar fills the gap with snapshots you control — stored where you decide.

## 🛡️ How Plakar Protects Your Proton Drive

Plakar securely **imports** your Proton Drive files, encrypts and deduplicates them locally (adding a second layer of privacy), then **stores** versioned snapshots in your Plakar repository (called a *Kloset*). You can even **store your Plakar backups on Proton Drive** for additional redundancy, or export them back when needed.

|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ❌ Accidental deletion          | Restore files or folders back to Proton Drive anytime               |
| 🦠 Malware or ransomware        | Immutable snapshots protect clean versions                          |
| 🔓 Account compromise           | Zero-trust design — Plakar’s encryption stays in your hands         |
| 📂 Limited versioning           | Plakar keeps full history with deduplication                        |
| 🔄 Storage flexibility          | Store Plakar snapshots on Proton Drive or another secure backend    |

## ✅ Common Use Cases

- Import Proton Drive files into an encrypted Plakar repository
- Store versioned backups **on Proton Drive** for easy access
- Export clean data back to Proton Drive after loss or corruption
- Keep an immutable offline copy for peace of mind
- Migrate Proton Drive content securely

## 🗺️ How It Works (At a Glance)

Proton Drive ⇄ Plakar Agent ⇄ Encrypted, Deduplicated Snapshots ⇄ Proton Drive or Other Storage

```

Files flow securely in, get chunked and double-encrypted, then stored wherever you decide.
