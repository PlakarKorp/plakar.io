  Back up your Proton Drive workloads with Plakar to protect against data loss,
  corruption, and ransomware. Immutable, encrypted, and restorable —
  even offline and across environments.

technology_title: Proton Drive is everywhere and often underprotected

technology_description: >
  Proton Drive is a privacy-first, end-to-end encrypted cloud storage service from Proton,
  trusted for storing sensitive files and documents. Its encryption ensures privacy,
  but native sync and trash features do not guarantee recovery from accidental deletion,
  ransomware, or account compromise.

  Plakar bridges this gap by enabling immutable, deduplicated, and encrypted backups
  of Proton Drive data, giving you control over versioning, recovery, and compliance.

## 🧠 Why protecting Proton Drive matters

Cloud sync and encryption protect privacy, but not against all risks. Files in Proton Drive can be lost to accidental deletion, overwritten by malware, or permanently removed after trash expiry. Account lockouts or credential loss can make data inaccessible, and compliance needs often require more than basic retention.

Without immutable backups, recovery from these scenarios is unreliable or impossible.

## 🔓 What happens when Proton Drive files are deleted or compromised?

If files are deleted—intentionally or by mistake—across synced devices, or if ransomware overwrites originals, Proton Drive’s native features may not help. Trash expiry or account suspension can make recovery impossible, and sync can propagate errors instantly.

Plakar addresses these risks by:

- Creating immutable, encrypted snapshots outside Proton Drive’s sync scope
- Enabling granular recovery of files or folders without full restore
- Supporting offline and air-gapped backup for true isolation

Your data remains safe, verifiable, and restorable—regardless of what happens in your live Proton Drive account.

## 🛡️ How Plakar secures your Proton Drive workflows

Plakar integrates with Proton Drive as both a source and destination:

- **Source connector:** Import and snapshot Proton Drive files, encrypt and deduplicate them, and store in a trusted Plakar Kloset.
- **Destination connector:** Export verified snapshots back to Proton Drive, restoring clean data after loss or corruption.
- **Storage connector:** Store Plakar snapshots on Proton Drive for redundancy and easy access.

Snapshots are immutable, versioned, and inspectable via CLI or UI—even offline.

## 🧰 Everything in one tool: backup, verify, restore, browse

Plakar provides a unified platform for Proton Drive protection:

- ✅ Immutable, versioned snapshots
- 🔐 End-to-end encryption at the chunk level
- 🧠 Global deduplication to minimize storage
