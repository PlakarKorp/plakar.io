  Back up your Scaleway Object Storage workloads with Plakar to protect against data loss,
  corruption, and ransomware. Immutable, encrypted, and restorable
  even offline and across environments.

technology_title: Scaleway Object Storage

technology_description: >
  Scaleway Object Storage is a high-durability, S3-compatible cloud storage service
  used for hosting application data, archives, and backups across multiple regions.

  Yet, even with geo-redundancy, Scaleway‚Äôs native protection can‚Äôt prevent accidental deletions,
  misconfigurations, ransomware, or credential compromises from impacting your data.
  Plakar integrates directly with Scaleway‚Äôs S3 API to provide immutable, deduplicated,
  and encrypted backups, complete with an integrated viewer for browsing snapshots
  without full extraction. This gives platform engineers, DevOps, sysadmins, and compliance
  teams a secure, auditable, and resilient backup layer.

## üß† Why protecting Scaleway Object Storage matters
Scaleway Object Storage is built for durability, and yet, that can‚Äôt prevent human error, malicious activity, or misconfiguration from impacting your data. Accidental deletions, incorrect lifecycle rules, or ransomware-synced changes can wipe out critical files across all replicas. Without immutable, offsite backups, recovery options are often slow, incomplete, or non-existent especially when your only copies live in the same account and region.

## üîì What happens when Scaleway Object Storage credentials get compromised?
With valid API credentials, an attacker can list, delete, overwrite, or encrypt every object in your buckets. In S3-compatible services like Scaleway, these actions can propagate instantly. If you don‚Äôt have an isolated, immutable backup outside the compromised environment, restoring original data may be impossible.

## üõ°Ô∏è How Plakar secures your Scaleway Object Storage workflows
Plakar integrates directly with Scaleway‚Äôs S3-compatible API to create immutable, deduplicated, encrypted snapshots of your buckets. Snapshots are stored in the Kloset format, ensuring that once written, data cannot be altered. Each backup is cryptographically verifiable and portable, so you can prove integrity and recover on any Plakar-compatible environment. Because Plakar supports an integrated viewer, you can browse and search backups directly in Scaleway without full extraction, making restores faster and more precise.

## üß∞ Everything in one tool: backup, verify, restore, browse
**Backup:** Continuous or scheduled backups directly to Scaleway buckets

**Verify:** Built-in cryptographic integrity checks for every snapshot

**Restore:** Recover full datasets or individual files to any environment

**Browse:** Search and preview backup contents instantly in Scaleway without extracting the whole archive
