# Filesystem Integration

## Overview

The **Plakar Filesystem integration** enables seamless backup and restoration of filesystems to and from a [Kloset repository](/posts/2025-04-29/kloset-the-immutable-data-store/).

This integration is designed to protect the data on your local hard drives, mounted NAS volumes, and SANs.

## Configuration

The Filesystem integration does not require any special configuration.

## Example Usage

To create the Kloset repository at `/var/backups` and back up the path `/etc` from your filesystem, you can use the following commands:

```bash
$ plakar at /var/backups create
$ plakar at /var/backups backup /etc
```

To restore data from the same Kloset repository to the current directory, use the following commands:

```bash
# List available backups
$ plakar at /var/backups ls

# Restore a specific file
$ plakar at /var/backups restore fc1b1e94:path/to/file.docx

# Restore the full backup
$ plakar at /var/backups restore fc1b1e94
```

See the [QuickStart guide](https://docs.plakar.io/en/quickstart/index.html) for more examples.

## Q&A

**Do you store file metadata?**

Yes, the Filesystem integration preserves file metadata, including permissions, timestamps, and ownership.
This ensures that the restored files retain their original attributes.

**Do you follow symlinks?**

Symlinks are backed up as symlinks, but their targets are not followed by default.

Following symlinks could be a security risk, as it may lead to backing up sensitive files outside the intended directory.

**Do you store extended attributes?**

Yes, the Filesystem integration preserves extended attributes (xattrs) of files and directories.
