# Plakar + Dropbox

Back up, restore, or replicate data between Dropbox and any Plakar-compatible backend — while keeping full control over snapshots, history, and encryption.

## Why you need Plakar with Dropbox

Dropbox is convenient for file sync, but not designed for long-term retention or protection from ransomware or human error.

Plakar turns your Dropbox files into encrypted, deduplicated backups stored anywhere you choose. You can later restore those backups to Dropbox or another platform — all while preserving full versioning and integrity.

## What is Dropbox?

Dropbox is a file syncing and sharing service trusted by individuals and teams worldwide. It automatically syncs files across devices and enables collaboration.

## Why integrate Plakar with Dropbox?

- No guaranteed data immutability
- Risk of sync-based deletion or overwrites
- Shared links can expose sensitive data
- Limited rollback capabilities

Plakar enhances Dropbox:

- ✅ Use it as a **source**: back up Dropbox folders
- ✅ Use it as a **destination**: export encrypted snapshots into Dropbox
- ✅ Use it as **storage**: store Plakar backup data directly on Dropbox

## How it works

Plakar pulls your files from Dropbox, chunks and encrypts them locally, then uploads only the new data to storage (if Dropbox is used as a backend). Snapshots are versioned and deduplicated. You can restore from any point-in-time version—even years later.

1. 📥 Import files and folders from Dropbox
2. 🔐 Encrypt data client-side
3. 📦 Create a snapshot (Kloset) with deduplication
4. ☁️ Store snapshots to Dropbox or any target backend

> Dropbox files are never modified directly — Plakar maintains separate encrypted structures.

## No more vendor lock-in

Back up to Dropbox today, restore to S3 or OneDrive tomorrow. Snapshots are portable and never tied to one cloud. That’s real freedom.

## Your responsibility

Whether personal or business use, it’s important to explain that the user is ultimately responsible for backups. Dropbox doesn’t guarantee data retention or integrity. Using Plakar gives you control.

## 🔄 TL;DR: Backups You Control

Plakar + Dropbox gives you:

✅ Encrypted, versioned backups
✅ End-to-end encryption (you own the keys)
✅ Deduplication to save space
✅ Zero-trust backup flows
✅ Visual inspection and audit readiness
✅ No cloud vendor lock-in
