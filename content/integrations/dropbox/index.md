  Back up your Dropbox workloads with Plakar to protect against data loss,
  corruption, and ransomware. Immutable, encrypted, and restorable
  even offline and across environments.

technology_title: Dropbox is everywhere and often underprotected

technology_description: >
  Dropbox is a leading cloud storage platform for individuals and teams, enabling seamless file sync, sharing, and collaboration across devices.
  Its convenience and ubiquity make it a cornerstone for personal and business data, but native Dropbox features do not guarantee true backup, immutability, or protection against sophisticated threats.
  Plakar adds a critical layer: encrypted, deduplicated, and versioned snapshots of your Dropbox, stored wherever you choose, ensuring resilience against deletion, corruption, and unauthorized access.

## 🧠 Why protecting Dropbox matters

Dropbox syncs and shares files instantly, but sync is not backup. Accidental deletions, ransomware, or sync errors can propagate across all devices, leading to permanent data loss. Dropbox’s retention policies are limited, and recovery options may not meet compliance or audit requirements. Without immutable, externalized backups, your Dropbox data remains vulnerable to silent corruption, overwrites, or account compromise.

## 🔓 What happens when Dropbox is compromised or data is lost?

If Dropbox credentials are leaked, ransomware encrypts files, or a user accidentally deletes critical data, the problem can spread rapidly across all linked devices and users. Native Dropbox recovery is limited by trash expiry and retention windows, and may not cover all scenarios. Once data is gone or corrupted, recovery is often impossible without a separate backup.

Plakar addresses these risks by:

- Creating immutable, encrypted snapshots outside Dropbox’s sync scope
- Storing backups with your own encryption keys, isolated from Dropbox access
- Allowing granular recovery of files or folders without full restore

Your data remains safe, verifiable, and restorable no matter what happens in your live Dropbox environment.

## 🛡️ How Plakar secures your Dropbox workflows

Plakar integrates with Dropbox as:

- A **source connector** to snapshot Dropbox data into encrypted, deduplicated backups
- A **restore destination** to rehydrate verified snapshots directly into Dropbox
- A **storage backend** to persist Plakar Kloset store in Dropbox, keeping backups portable and secure

Plakar adds end-to-end encryption, global deduplication, versioning, and snapshot browsing online or offline so you control your data’s safety and recoverability.

## 🧰 Everything in one tool: backup, verify, restore, browse

With Plakar, you get:

- ✅ Immutable, versioned snapshots of Dropbox data
- 🔐 End-to-end encryption with keys you own
- 🧠 Deduplication to minimize storage footprint
