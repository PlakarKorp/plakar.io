# Plakar + Dropbox: Secure, Encrypted Backups for Your Cloud Files

Dropbox is everywhere—syncing your files, photos, and docs across devices and teams. But what happens when something goes wrong?

- 🧍 Accidental file deletion or overwrites
- 🦠 Ransomware or malware encrypting your Dropbox
- 🔓 Leaked credentials or compromised access

Plakar gives you control: encrypted, deduplicated, and versioned snapshots of your Dropbox, stored wherever you choose. Restore, audit, or export—on your terms.

Because true resilience means owning your backup, not just trusting the cloud.

## 🧠 What is Dropbox?

Dropbox is a cloud storage platform used by millions to sync, share, and collaborate on files. It’s convenient, but not immune to data loss, sync errors, or attacks.

## 🔗 How Plakar Integrates with Dropbox

Plakar supports Dropbox in three powerful ways:

- **Backup**: Import and snapshot your Dropbox data into Plakar’s encrypted, deduplicated backup system.
- **Restore**: Restore data from any Plakar backup (even from other sources) directly into your Dropbox.
- **Repository Storage**: Use Dropbox as the storage backend for your Plakar repository (Kloset), keeping your encrypted backups safe and portable in the cloud.

This flexibility means you can use Dropbox as a source, a destination, or a storage location for your entire backup repository.

## 🚨 Why Dropbox Needs Backup (Even With Sync)

>Sync ≠ backup. It can spread mistakes, not protect against them.

If a file is deleted, corrupted, or encrypted by ransomware, Dropbox’s sync can instantly propagate the problem across all devices and users. Dropbox’s retention policies are limited, and recovery is not guaranteed.

That’s where Plakar steps in.

## 🛡️ How Plakar Protects Your Dropbox

Plakar creates encrypted, content-aware snapshots of your Dropbox data.

| **Risk**                        | **How Plakar Helps**                                            |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧍 Accidental deletion           | Restore from a snapshot to recover lost files                    |
| 🦠 Ransomware or malware         | Snapshots are immutable and encrypted from the start             |
| 🔓 Leaked credentials            | Backups are stored separately, with your own encryption keys     |
| 📉 Sync errors or version loss   | Full history is preserved—restore any file, any time             |
| 🪝 Vendor lock-in                | Export or restore to any provider, not just Dropbox              |

## ⚠️ What Dropbox Sync Doesn’t Cover

Dropbox’s built-in sync and trash features don’t protect you from:

- Permanent deletion after trash expiry
- Ransomware or mass overwrite
- Account lockout or suspension
- Audit and compliance needs

Plakar snapshots are immutable, encrypted, and stored where you choose—giving you true control.

## Your responsibility

Whether for personal or business use, you are ultimately responsible for your own backups. Dropbox does not guarantee data retention or integrity—using Plakar gives you true control over your data’s safety and recoverability.

## 🔄 TL;DR: Backups You Own

Plakar + Dropbox gives you:

✅ Snapshots with rollback and metadata  
✅ End-to-end encryption (you own the keys)  
✅ Deduplication to save space  
✅ Zero-trust backup flows  
✅ Visual inspection and audit readiness  
✅ No cloud vendor lock-in
