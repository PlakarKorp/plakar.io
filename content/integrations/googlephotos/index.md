  Back up your Google Photos content with Plakar to protect against data loss,
  accidental deletion, and privacy breaches. Immutable, encrypted, and restorable —
  even offline and across devices.

technology_title: Google Photos is everywhere and often underprotected

technology_description: >
  Google Photos is a leading cloud-based service for storing and organizing personal and family memories, trusted by millions for its convenience and AI-powered features.

  However, Google Photos alone does not provide true data ownership, immutability, or portable backups. Account loss, export limitations, and cloud lock-in can put memories at risk.

  Plakar bridges this gap by enabling encrypted, deduplicated, and versioned backups of your Google Photos library, giving you full control and auditability.

## 🧠 Why protecting Google Photos matters

Photos and videos are irreplaceable, but cloud storage is not a backup. Google Photos accounts can be lost due to accidental deletion, policy violations, or credential compromise. Native exports are slow, manual, and often incomplete, making recovery difficult.

Without independent, immutable backups, memories can be silently lost, corrupted, or locked away by account issues or service changes.

## 🔓 What happens when Google Photos access is lost or exports fail?

If you lose access to your Google account, or if exports via Takeout are interrupted or incomplete:

- Albums and metadata may be missing or out of order
- Duplicates and partial exports waste time and storage
- There is no incremental backup or easy audit trail

Native tools do not guarantee full recovery or verification. Plakar addresses these risks by:

- Creating immutable, encrypted snapshots of your library
- Storing backups outside Google’s ecosystem for true ownership
- Enabling granular recovery and inspection without full restores

Your memories remain safe, verifiable, and portable — even if your account is compromised or deleted.

## 🛡️ How Plakar secures your Google Photos workflows

Plakar integrates with Google Photos as both a source and destination:

- **Source connector:** Import your entire library or selected albums into an encrypted, deduplicated repository (Kloset)
- **Destination connector:** Export verified snapshots back to Google Photos or another service, preserving structure and metadata

Plakar adds end-to-end encryption, global deduplication, versioning, and offline access. Snapshots are inspectable via UI or CLI, and can be exported for compliance or long-term archiving.

## 🧰 Everything in one tool: backup, verify, restore, browse

With Plakar, you get:

- ✅ Immutable, versioned snapshots of your Google Photos library
- 🔐 End-to-end encryption — you own the keys
- 🧠 Deduplication to save space and bandwidth
- 🔎 Visual inspection and audit readiness
- 📦 Offline export and long-term retention

Plakar centralizes backup, verification, restoration, and browsing for Google Photos, giving you full control and peace of mind — no cloud lock-in, no manual exports, no guesswork.
