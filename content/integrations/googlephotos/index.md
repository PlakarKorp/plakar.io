# Plakar + Google Photos: Your Memories, Encrypted and Portable

Google Photos keeps your memories in the cloud — but moving, securing, or managing them on your terms can be surprisingly hard.

- 📸 Albums grow fast, eating up storage limits
- 🔄 Exports via Takeout are bulky, manual, and slow
- 🔓 Losing account access can mean losing everything

🔐 **Plakar lets you import your entire Google Photos library into an encrypted, versioned repository — and export it back, on demand, with zero guesswork.**

Because your photos should belong to you, not just the cloud.

> *👉 Get started with the [setup guide](docs/main/integrations/googlephotos/)*

## 🧠 What is Google Photos?

Google Photos is one of the world’s most popular services for storing and sharing photos and videos. It automatically syncs across devices and offers AI-powered organization.

But when it comes to **moving or safeguarding** thousands of memories, the native tools often fall short.

## 🚨 Why Moving Google Photos Needs Better Tools

Google Photos does its job well — but migrating or extracting your library can feel like pulling teeth:

- Takeout archives are huge and error-prone
- No incremental export for daily changes
- Hard to verify what’s missing or duplicated

🎯 That’s where Plakar helps you **take control** of your own archive.

## 🛡️ How Plakar Handles Your Google Photos

Plakar connects to your Google Photos library, **imports** your albums into an encrypted, content-aware repository (called a *Kloset*), and lets you **export** them back to Google Photos or another destination — exactly as you choose.

|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 📸 Massive library size            | Incremental imports prevent redundant downloads                |
| 🔄 Duplicates and partial exports  | Content-based deduplication means no wasted storage            |
| 🔓 Privacy & access concerns       | All data is encrypted locally — you own the keys               |
| 🗂️ Album structure preservation    | Keep albums, metadata, and timestamps intact                   |
| 🔄 Easy re-upload                  | Restore or migrate to Google Photos, whenever you want         |

## ✅ Common Use Cases

- Import your full Google Photos library into a secure Plakar repository
