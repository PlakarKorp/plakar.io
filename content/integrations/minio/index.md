# Plakar + MinIO backup solution: protect your object storage from data loss and ransomware

MinIO is fast. Scalable. Battle-tested across edge, hybrid, and private cloud deployments.
But even the best object storage can't protect you from everything:

- 🧍 One accidental `rm -rf`
- 🦠 Bit rot and silent corruption
- 🔓 Leaked credentials or compromised access

🔐 Plakar makes your MinIO data immutable, encrypted, and rollback-ready, by design.

Because resilience isn’t a feature. It’s a mindset.

## 🧠 What is MinIO?

MinIO is a high-performance, S3-compatible object storage system.
It’s open-source, built for speed, and optimized for modern workloads, from machine learning pipelines to application state.

Its S3 API compatibility makes it easy to integrate, but like any storage, it’s only as safe as your last clean backup.


## 🚨 Why MinIO needs backup (even with replication)

>Replication ≠ backup. It can replicate mistakes, not protect against them.

MinIO offers excellent durability, but not reversibility. If a file is deleted, corrupted, or encrypted by ransomware, that failure can instantly sync across your entire cluster.

Replication won’t help you:

- Restore a known-good state
- Recover a single object without versioning
- Audit what changed, and when

🎯 That’s where Plakar steps in.

## 🛡️ How Plakar protects your MinIO buckets

Plakar creates encrypted, content-aware snapshots of your MinIO buckets.

| **Risk**                        | **How Plakar helps**                                            |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧍 Accidental deletion           | Restore from a snapshot to recover lost data                    |
| 🦠 Bit rot or silent corruption  | Every chunk is verified by its content hash                     |
| 🔓 Ransomware or tampering       | Snapshots are immutable and encrypted from the start            |
| 📉 Gaps in versioning or metadata | Full history is preserved in the Kloset Store                  |
| 🪝 Cloud or vendor lock-in       | Use MinIO as your storage backend with no hidden dependencies   |

## ⚠️ But backups aren’t the only challenge
Even with MinIO’s Site Replication, some critical parts of your data and configuration aren’t copied at all.

## ⛔ What MinIO replication doesn’t cover

MinIO skips:

- 🔔 Bucket notifications
- 🧬 Lifecycle (ILM) rules
- 🛠️ Site-level config settings

This can lead to configuration drift, policy gaps, or incomplete recovery.

Plakar doesn’t just replicate your data, it captures the full state of your storage exactly as it is, every time.

## 🔄 TL;DR: backups you control

Plakar + MinIO gives you:

- ✅ Snapshots with rollback and metadata 
- ✅ Encryption at the chunk level 
- ✅ Support for any topology 
- ✅ Zero-trust backup flows 
- ✅ Visual inspection and audit readiness 
- ✅ No cloud vendor lock-in
