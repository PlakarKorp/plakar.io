  Back up your OpenDrive workloads with Plakar to protect against data loss,

technology_title: OpenDrive is everywhere and often underprotected

technology_description: >
  OpenDrive is a flexible cloud storage and backup platform for individuals and businesses, supporting file sync, online storage, and collaboration. Its accessibility and ease of use make it a popular choice for storing critical data, but native protections like versioning and trash bins are limited and can be bypassed or exhausted. Plakar helps secure OpenDrive by providing encrypted, immutable backups, ensuring you can restore files after deletion, corruption, or compromise, and maintain compliance and resilience across environments.

## 🧠 Why protecting OpenDrive matters

Relying solely on OpenDrive’s built-in sync and versioning exposes you to risks like silent corruption, accidental deletion, ransomware, or account compromise. Permanent data loss or compliance failures can occur if files are deleted or tampered with and no independent backup exists. Without robust, externalized backups, recovery options are limited and downtime can be costly.

## 🔓 What if your OpenDrive is deleted or compromised?

OpenDrive’s native protections may not be enough if files are deleted, overwritten by malware, or accessed with leaked credentials. Permanent deletions or ransomware attacks can propagate quickly, leaving no clean copy to restore. Plakar mitigates these risks by:

- Creating immutable, encrypted snapshots outside OpenDrive’s access scope
- Storing backups in external or air-gapped locations
- Enabling granular recovery of individual files or folders without full restores

Your data remains safe, verifiable, and restorable, regardless of what happens in your live OpenDrive environment.

## 🛡️ How Plakar secures your OpenDrive workflows

Plakar integrates with OpenDrive as both a source and destination:

- Snapshot files and folders from OpenDrive, encrypt and deduplicate them, and store them in a trusted Kloset store
- Restore verified snapshots back into OpenDrive or other environments, on-prem or cloud-based
- Use OpenDrive as a Plakar Kloset stores, keeping backups portable and secure

Plakar adds end-to-end encryption, global deduplication, versioning, and snapshot browsing giving you full control over backup and restore, even offline or across providers.
