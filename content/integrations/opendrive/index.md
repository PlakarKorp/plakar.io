# Plakar + OpenDrive: Flexible Cloud Backups with Total Control

OpenDrive makes storing and syncing files simple — but simple sync isn’t enough to handle every risk.

Your files can disappear or get corrupted in an instant:

- 🚫 One accidental deletion can sync everywhere
- 🦠 Malware or ransomware can overwrite files
- 🔓 Weak credentials can expose private data

🔐 **Plakar lets you import, store, and export your OpenDrive files as encrypted, versioned backups — so you’re never at the mercy of a single copy.**

Because your cloud files should always be yours to restore.

> *👉 Get started with the [setup guide](docs/main/integrations/opendrive/)*

## 🧠 What is OpenDrive?

OpenDrive is a cloud storage platform for online file backup, sync, and sharing — popular for its flexibility across personal and business use cases.

But like any sync service, its native versioning and trash bins aren’t foolproof when disaster hits.

## 🚨 Why OpenDrive Needs Real Backups

OpenDrive syncs data fast — but fast sync can replicate mistakes just as fast.

Native features like file history help, but can’t protect you if:

- A file is permanently deleted
- Ransomware encrypts your folders
- You need to restore a folder exactly as it was weeks ago

🎯 Plakar steps in with encrypted, immutable snapshots you control.

## 🛡️ How Plakar Protects Your OpenDrive

Plakar securely **imports** your OpenDrive files, encrypts and deduplicates them locally, and **stores** versioned snapshots in your Plakar repository (called a *Kloset*). You can even **store your Plakar backups on OpenDrive** for extra redundancy, or export them back when needed.

| **Risk**                        | **How Plakar Helps**                                              |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🚫 Accidental deletion           | Restore any file or folder to OpenDrive exactly as it was          |
| 🦠 Malware or ransomware         | Immutable, encrypted snapshots keep clean versions safe            |
| 🔓 Account compromise            | Zero-trust design — you own the encryption keys                    |
| 📂 Partial versioning            | Plakar preserves full history with deduplication                   |
| 🔄 Storage flexibility           | Store snapshots on OpenDrive or elsewhere — your choice            |

## ✅ Common Use Cases

- Import your OpenDrive files into a secure Plakar repository
- Store daily encrypted snapshots **on OpenDrive**
- Export clean folders back to OpenDrive after loss or overwrite
- Archive long-term versions without cloud lock-in
- Migrate OpenDrive content to another provider securely
