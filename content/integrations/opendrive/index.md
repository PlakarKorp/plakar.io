  OpenDrive is a versatile cloud storage and backup service for individuals and businesses, offering file sync, online storage, and collaboration tools. Its flexibility makes it a popular choice for storing critical data, but native protections like versioning and trash bins are limited. Plakar helps you secure OpenDrive data with encrypted, immutable backups, ensuring you can restore files even after deletion, corruption, or compromise.

## üß† Why protecting OpenDrive matters

OpenDrive is often the central repository for personal and business files, but relying solely on its built-in sync and versioning exposes you to risks. Silent corruption, accidental deletion, ransomware, or account compromise can result in permanent data loss or compliance failures. Without robust, independent backups, recovery options are limited and downtime can be costly.

## üîì What happens when OpenDrive is compromised

If files are deleted, overwritten by malware, or accessed with leaked credentials, OpenDrive‚Äôs native protections may not be enough. Permanent deletions or ransomware attacks can propagate quickly, leaving no clean copy to restore. Plakar addresses these risks with immutable, encrypted snapshots, externalized storage for air-gap protection, and granular recovery‚Äîso you can restore exactly what you need without relying on OpenDrive‚Äôs limited history.

## üõ°Ô∏è How Plakar secures your OpenDrive workflows

Plakar integrates with OpenDrive as both a source and destination: import files from OpenDrive, store encrypted snapshots locally or in the cloud, and export clean data back when needed. Plakar adds end-to-end encryption, deduplication, versioning, and snapshot browsing‚Äîgiving you full control over your backup and restore process, even offline or across providers.

## üß∞ Everything in one tool: backup, verify, restore, browse

Plakar provides immutable snapshots, end-to-end encryption, and efficient deduplication for your OpenDrive data. Inspect and verify backups on demand via UI or CLI, export to cold storage, and restore any file or folder as needed. With Plakar, you get a transparent, all-in-one solution for protecting, auditing, and managing your OpenDrive workflows‚Äîno cloud lock-in, maximum resilience.
