# Plakar + Rclone: Universal Cloud Backup & Restore

Rclone is your gateway to the cloud. With support for providers like OpenDrive, OneDrive, iCloud Drive, Proton Drive, Koofr, Google Drive, Google Photos, and Dropbox, Rclone lets Plakar connect to almost any cloud storage you use.

But cloud storage alone isn’t enough. Accidental deletions, silent corruption, or ransomware can strike anywhere.

🔐 Plakar makes your cloud data immutable, encrypted, and deduplicated—no matter which provider you choose.

## 🧠 What is Rclone?

Rclone is a powerful CLI tool for syncing, copying, and managing files across dozens of cloud providers. It abstracts away provider-specific quirks, letting you treat all your cloud accounts as one unified storage layer.

## 🚨 Why Use Plakar with Rclone?

Rclone provides a simple way to connect Plakar to your cloud storage accounts. By configuring Rclone remotes, you can quickly link Plakar to services like Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, and more—no complex setup required.

Plakar adds:

- Immutable, encrypted snapshots of your cloud data
- Deduplication to save space and bandwidth
- Rollback and restore to any point in time
- Audit trails for every change

## 🛡️ How Plakar Protects Your Cloud Data

Plakar + Rclone means you can:

| **Risk**                        | **How Plakar Helps**                                            |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧍 Accidental deletion           | Restore files from any snapshot                                 |
| 🦠 Bit rot or silent corruption  | Content hashes verify every chunk                               |
| 🔓 Ransomware or tampering       | Snapshots are immutable and encrypted                          |
| 📉 Provider versioning gaps      | Full history in the Kloset Store                               |
| 🪝 Cloud lock-in                 | Move data between providers with no hidden dependencies         |

## ⚠️ What Rclone Alone Can’t Do

Rclone is great for moving files, but it doesn’t provide:

- Immutable backups
- Versioned snapshots
- End-to-end encryption and deduplication
- End-to-end encryption and deduplication
- Rollback to a known-good state
- Visual browsing of your documents without restoring them locally

Plakar fills these gaps, making your cloud storage truly resilient.

## 🔄 TL;DR: Backups You Control

Plakar + Rclone gives you:

✅ Snapshots with rollback and metadata  
✅ Encryption at the chunk level  
✅ Support for any cloud provider  
✅ Zero-trust backup flows  
✅ Visual inspection and audit readiness  
✅ No vendor lock-in

## 🌐 Supported Cloud Providers

Plakar, via Rclone, can connect to a wide range of cloud storage services. Some of the major providers you can use include:

- [Google Drive](docs/main/integrations/googledrive/)
- [Dropbox](docs/main/integrations/dropbox/)
