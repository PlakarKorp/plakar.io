# Plakar + iCloud Drive: Keep Your Apple Files Safe on Your Terms

iCloud Drive keeps your documents and app files accessible on all your Apple devices. But “sync” is not the same as “backup.”

A single mistake or threat can ripple through every device:

- ❌ A deleted file vanishes everywhere
- 🦠 Malware or corruption spreads automatically
- 🔓 Stolen credentials put your files at risk

🔐 **Plakar lets you import, store, and export your iCloud Drive files as encrypted, versioned snapshots — so you decide what stays, what rolls back, and where it lives.**

Because your files deserve more than sync — they deserve true resilience.

> 👉 Get started with the [setup guide](docs/main/integrations/icloud-drive/)

> ⚠️ **Note:** This integration covers **iCloud Drive files only** — it does **not** handle iCloud Photos. Use the [Google Photos integration](docs/main/integrations/google-photos/) for photo libraries.


## 🧠 What is iCloud Drive?

iCloud Drive is Apple’s cloud storage for files, folders, and app data. It syncs across Macs, iPhones, and iPads, keeping everything up to date — but it can’t roll back when accidents strike.

## 🚨 Why iCloud Drive Needs More Than Sync

Sync is great until something goes wrong:

- Deleted files are gone on every device.
- Versioning is limited and often hidden.
- Malware or user error can overwrite valuable data instantly.

🎯 Plakar fills the gap with encrypted, immutable snapshots you control — even storing them back on iCloud Drive if you want.

## 🛡️ How Plakar Protects Your iCloud Drive

Plakar securely **imports** your iCloud Drive files, encrypts and deduplicates them locally, and **stores** versioned snapshots in your Plakar backup repository (called a *Kloset*). You can even **store Plakar backups on iCloud Drive**, or export them back when needed.

| **Risk**                       | **How Plakar Helps**                                             |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ❌ Accidental deletion          | Restore any file or folder back to iCloud Drive exactly as it was |
| 🦠 Malware or ransomware        | Immutable, encrypted snapshots protect your clean versions        |
| 🔓 Account compromise           | Zero-trust design — you own the encryption keys                   |
| 📂 Limited versioning           | Plakar keeps full file history with deduplication                 |
| 🔄 Storage flexibility          | Store snapshots on iCloud Drive or another secure backend         |

## ✅ Common Use Cases

- Import iCloud Drive files into a secure Plakar repository
- Store daily snapshots **on iCloud Drive** for redundancy
- Export clean files or folders back to iCloud Drive anytime
- Archive critical documents outside Apple’s ecosystem
- Keep an offline, immutable copy for compliance
