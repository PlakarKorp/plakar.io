  Back up your iCloud Drive files with Plakar to protect against data loss,

technology_title: iCloud Drive is everywhere and often underprotected

technology_description: >
  iCloud Drive is Apple’s cloud file storage service, keeping documents, folders, and app data synced across your Apple devices.
  It’s trusted for seamless access and sharing, but native sync does not provide true backup, versioning, or protection against accidental deletion and compromise.
  Plakar fills the gap by enabling encrypted, deduplicated, and versioned snapshots of your iCloud Drive files, giving you control over retention, recovery, and compliance.

## 🧠 Why protecting iCloud Drive matters

iCloud Drive syncs files across all your Apple devices, but sync is not backup. If files are deleted, corrupted, or compromised, those changes propagate everywhere instantly. Without immutable backups, you risk silent data loss, ransomware spread, or compliance failures — and recovery options are limited or unavailable.

## 🔓 What happens when iCloud Drive files are deleted or compromised?

A mistaken deletion, malware infection, or stolen credentials can wipe or corrupt your files across every device. Native versioning is limited and often hidden, making recovery unreliable. If you need to restore a specific version or recover from a major incident, iCloud Drive alone cannot guarantee data integrity or rollback.
Icloud can be backed up by Apple but it is not free and after 180 days it is deleted, and it does not provide the level of control and security that Plakar offers.

Plakar addresses these risks by:

- Creating immutable, encrypted snapshots outside the iCloud sync scope
- Enabling granular recovery of files or folders without full restore
- Supporting offline and air-gapped backup options for true isolation

Your backups remain safe, verifiable, and restorable — even if your iCloud account is compromised.

## 🛡️ How Plakar secures your iCloud Drive workflows

Plakar integrates with iCloud Drive as both a source and destination:

- **Source connector:** Import and snapshot your iCloud Drive files, encrypt and deduplicate them, and store in a trusted Plakar Kloset.
- **Destination connector:** Export clean, verified files or folders back to iCloud Drive as needed.
- **Storage connector:** Optionally store Plakar snapshots on iCloud Drive for redundancy or compliance.

Snapshots are immutable, versioned, and inspectable via CLI or UI, with end-to-end encryption and global deduplication.

## 🧰 Everything in one tool: backup, verify, restore, browse

Plakar provides a unified platform for iCloud Drive protection:

- ✅ Immutable, versioned snapshots
- 🔐 End-to-end encryption (you own the keys)
- 🧠 Deduplication to save space and bandwidth
- 🔎 Visual inspection and audit readiness via UI or CLI
- 📦 Offline export and long-term retention

From backup creation to granular restore, Plakar centralizes all workflows for iCloud Drive, ensuring your Apple files are resilient, compliant, and always under your control.

⚠️ The ICloud Drive api does not give access to the picture in iCloud Photos, so you cannot back up your iCloud Photos library with this integration.
