# FTP Integration

## Overview

The **FTP integration** provides support for the legacy, though still around, FTP protocol.

It can either backup from a public FTP server or restore to an authentication-less FTP server, a local NAS for example.

## Configuration

The **FTP integration** does not require any particular configuration.


## Example Usage

To back up the path `/pub/PlakarKorp` from FTP server located at `example.org`, you can use the following command:

```sh
$ plakar at /var/backups backup ftp://example.org/pub/PlakarKorp
```

To restore data to authentication-less FTP server located at `example.org`, use the following command:

```sh
$ plakar at /var/backups restore -to ftp://example.org/pub/PlakarKorp fc1b1e94
```

See the [QuickStart guide](https://docs.plakar.io/en/quickstart/index.html) for more examples.

## Q&A

**Do you store file metadata?**

The **FTP integration** cannot guarantee preservation of metadata,
as each FTP server may expose more or less informations,
but will preserve all of the exposed metadata.
