# Plakar + Google Drive: Secure, Encrypted Backups for Your Cloud Files

Google Drive is everywhere—syncing your files, photos, and docs across devices and teams. But what happens when something goes wrong?

- 🧍 Accidental file deletion or overwrites
- 🦠 Ransomware or malware encrypting your Drive
- 🔓 Leaked credentials or compromised access

Plakar gives you control: encrypted, deduplicated, and versioned snapshots of your Google Drive, stored wherever you choose. Restore, audit, or export—on your terms.

Because true resilience means owning your backup, not just trusting the cloud.

## 🧠 What is Google Drive?

Google Drive is a cloud storage platform from Google, used by millions to sync, share, and collaborate on files. It’s convenient, but not immune to data loss, sync errors, or attacks.

## � How Plakar Integrates with Google Drive

Plakar supports Google Drive in three powerful ways:

- **Backup**: Import and snapshot your Google Drive data into Plakar’s encrypted, deduplicated backup system.
- **Restore**: Restore data from any Plakar backup (even from other sources) directly into your Google Drive.
- **Repository Storage**: Use Google Drive as the storage backend for your Plakar repository (Kloset), keeping your encrypted backups safe and portable in the cloud.

This flexibility means you can use Google Drive as a source, a destination, or a storage location for your entire backup repository.

## �🚨 Why Google Drive Needs Backup (Even With Sync)

>Sync ≠ backup. It can spread mistakes, not protect against them.

If a file is deleted, corrupted, or encrypted by ransomware, Drive’s sync can instantly propagate the problem across all devices and users. Google’s retention policies are limited, and recovery is not guaranteed.

That’s where Plakar steps in.

## 🛡️ How Plakar Protects Your Google Drive

Plakar creates encrypted, content-aware snapshots of your Google Drive data.

| **Risk**                        | **How Plakar Helps**                                            |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧍 Accidental deletion           | Restore from a snapshot to recover lost files                    |
| 🦠 Ransomware or malware         | Snapshots are immutable and encrypted from the start             |
| 🔓 Leaked credentials            | Backups are stored separately, with your own encryption keys     |
| 📉 Sync errors or version loss   | Full history is preserved—restore any file, any time             |
| 🪝 Vendor lock-in                | Export or restore to any provider, not just Google               |

## ⚠️ What Google Drive Sync Doesn’t Cover

Google Drive’s built-in sync and trash features don’t protect you from:

- Permanent deletion after trash expiry
- Ransomware or mass overwrite
- Account lockout or suspension
- Audit and compliance needs

Plakar snapshots are immutable, encrypted, and stored where you choose—giving you true control.

## Your responsibility

Whether for personal or business use, you are ultimately responsible for your own backups. Google does not guarantee data retention or integrity—using Plakar gives you true control over your data’s safety and recoverability.

## 🔄 TL;DR: Backups You Own

Plakar + Google Drive gives you:

✅ Snapshots with rollback and metadata  
✅ End-to-end encryption (you own the keys)  
✅ Deduplication to save space  
✅ Zero-trust backup flows  
✅ Visual inspection and audit readiness  
✅ No cloud vendor lock-in
