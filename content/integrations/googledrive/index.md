  Back up your Google Drive workloads with Plakar to protect against data loss,
  corruption, and ransomware. Immutable, encrypted, and restorable —
  even offline and across environments.

technology_title: Google Drive is everywhere and often underprotected

technology_description: >
  Google Drive is a widely used cloud storage service for individuals and businesses,
  syncing files across devices and teams for seamless collaboration and access.

  Yet, Google Drive is often deployed without robust safeguards against accidental deletion,
  ransomware, sync errors, or account compromise. Plakar helps by enabling encrypted,
  deduplicated, and versioned backups of your Drive data, stored wherever you choose—
  ensuring recoverability and auditability beyond native retention policies.

## 🧠 Why protecting Google Drive matters

Google Drive is trusted for everyday work and collaboration, but its convenience can mask real risks. Data can be silently corrupted, deleted by mistake, or encrypted by ransomware—often with sync propagating the issue instantly across all devices and users. Native retention and recovery options are limited, and compliance needs may go unmet without immutable, verifiable backups.

## 🔓 What happens when Google Drive is compromised or data is lost?

If your Google Drive credentials are leaked, or files are deleted or overwritten—whether by accident, malware, or sync error—data can vanish instantly across all connected devices. Google’s trash and retention policies offer only short-term protection, and recovery is not guaranteed.

Plakar addresses these risks by:

- Creating immutable, encrypted snapshots stored outside Google’s ecosystem
- Enabling air-gapped or access-isolated backup storage
- Allowing granular recovery of individual files or entire folders without full restore

Your data remains safe, verifiable, and restorable—no matter what happens in your live Google Drive.

## 🛡️ How Plakar secures your Google Drive workflows

Plakar integrates with Google Drive in multiple ways:

- As a **source connector**, Plakar snapshots your Drive data, encrypts and deduplicates it, and stores it in a trusted Kloset repository.
- As a **restore destination**, Plakar can rehydrate verified snapshots directly into Google Drive, preserving structure and metadata.
- As a **storage backend**, you can use Google Drive to store encrypted Plakar snapshots from any source, keeping backups portable and accessible.

Snapshots are immutable, versioned, and inspectable via CLI or UI—even offline.

## 🧰 Everything in one tool: backup, verify, restore, browse

Plakar centralizes your Google Drive backup workflows:

- ✅ Immutable, versioned snapshots
- 🔐 End-to-end encryption (you own the keys)
