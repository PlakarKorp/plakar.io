# Plakar + Google Drive: Take Back Control of Your Cloud Files

Google Drive makes storing and sharing files simple. But simple doesn’t mean foolproof.

Your Drive is only as safe as your last clean backup — and Google’s native recovery options aren’t bulletproof:

- 🚫 Accidental deletion goes to Trash, but Trash can be emptied.
- 🦠 Malware or ransomware can overwrite or encrypt files.
- 🔓 Shared links or compromised accounts expose data to leaks.

🔐 **Plakar turns your Google Drive into an immutable, encrypted backup vault — owned and controlled by you.**

Because “cloud convenience” shouldn’t mean “cloud blind spots.”

## 🧠 What is Google Drive?

Google Drive is a leading cloud storage service that lets you store, sync, and share files across devices.

Millions of individuals and businesses rely on Drive every day — but native versioning and retention only go so far when disaster strikes.

## 🚨 Why Google Drive Needs Real Backups

Google Drive’s built-in protection can’t fully defend you from:

- Permanent deletion (when Trash is emptied)
- Silent overwrites or sync conflicts
- Ransomware or malware encryption
- Stale files with no history

Plakar fills the gap with **immutable snapshots** that no one — not even an attacker with Drive access — can alter or erase.

## 🛡️ How Plakar Protects Your Google Drive

Plakar doesn’t just back up your Google Drive — it lets you **store**, **restore**, and **manage** your Drive data on your own terms.

Here’s how it works: Plakar pulls content from your Drive, breaks it into chunks, encrypts everything locally, then stores versioned snapshots in your Plakar backup repository (called a *Kloset*). You can keep these snapshots off-cloud, or even store the Plakar backup data **on Google Drive itself** for additional redundancy.

| **Risk**                        | **How Plakar Helps**                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🚫 Accidental deletion          | Restore any file or folder to Google Drive from any point in time |
| 🦠 Malware or ransomware        | Snapshots are immutable and fully encrypted at rest               |
| 🔓 Credential leaks or breaches | Backups are stored separately, with zero-trust access controls    |
| 🧩 Partial versioning gaps      | Plakar’s content-aware deduplication covers every change          |
| 🔄 Vendor lock-in               | Use Drive as a backup source **and** storage target — your choice |

So whether you need to **back up**, **restore**, or **store** data *on* Google Drive, Plakar keeps every version secure and verifiable.

## ✅ Common Use Cases

- Archive business-critical Drive folders off-cloud
- Mirror Drive data to a secure Plakar repository for DR
- Automate daily Drive snapshots for compliance
- Inspect and audit file history visually
- Migrate data without losing version history
