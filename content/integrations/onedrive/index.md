  Back up your OneDrive workloads with Plakar to protect against data loss,
  corruption, and ransomware. Immutable, encrypted, and restorable —
  even offline and across environments.

technology_title: OneDrive is everywhere and often underprotected

technology_description: >
  OneDrive is Microsoft’s cloud storage solution for individuals and businesses,
  seamlessly integrated with Office 365 and Windows. It powers collaboration,
  file sync, and sharing across devices and teams.

  Yet, OneDrive’s native protection is limited: deletions, ransomware, or account breaches
  can propagate instantly, and retention policies may not cover every scenario.
  Plakar adds a layer of encrypted, versioned, and deduplicated backups—giving you
  control, auditability, and resilience beyond standard cloud storage.

## 🧠 Why protecting OneDrive matters

Cloud sync is not backup. OneDrive’s convenience can mask risks: silent corruption, accidental deletion, ransomware, or compromised credentials can lead to rapid, irreversible data loss. Retention and version history help, but they’re not enough for compliance, audit, or long-term recovery. Without immutable, externalized backups, your files remain vulnerable to threats that propagate faster than you can react.

## 🔓 What happens when OneDrive is compromised?

If files are deleted locally, OneDrive syncs those deletions to the cloud—sometimes before you notice. Ransomware or malware can encrypt files and sync the damage across all devices. A breach of your Microsoft account can expose or wipe entire libraries. Native recovery options are limited by retention windows and version history, which may not cover every scenario.

Plakar addresses these risks by:

- Creating immutable, encrypted snapshots outside your OneDrive account
- Enabling granular recovery of files or folders without full restores
- Supporting offline and air-gapped backup flows for true isolation

No matter what happens in your live OneDrive, your snapshots remain safe, verifiable, and restorable.

## 🛡️ How Plakar secures your OneDrive workflows

Plakar integrates with OneDrive as both a source and destination:

- **Source connector:** Import and snapshot your OneDrive files, encrypt and deduplicate them, and store in a trusted Plakar Kloset.
- **Destination connector:** Export clean, verified snapshots back to OneDrive, restoring files or folders exactly as they were.
- **Storage connector:** Store Plakar snapshots on OneDrive itself, adding a self-managed, encrypted backup layer inside your existing cloud.

Snapshots are immutable, portable, and inspectable via CLI or UI—even if stored offline.

## 🧰 Everything in one tool: backup, verify, restore, browse

With Plakar, you get:

- ✅ Immutable, versioned snapshots of your OneDrive data
- 🔐 End-to-end encryption (you own the keys)
