  Back up your Koofr workloads with Plakar to protect against data loss,

  even offline and across environments.

technology_description: >
  Koofr is a privacy-focused European cloud storage service that unifies multiple storage accounts
  under one secure interface. It‚Äôs trusted for personal and business file storage, sharing, and
  multi-cloud management, all with a strong commitment to privacy.

  However, Koofr‚Äôs native tools do not provide true immutability, granular versioning, or portable
  encrypted backups. Plakar extends Koofr‚Äôs protection by enabling encrypted, deduplicated, and
  verifiable snapshots giving you control over your data, even beyond Koofr‚Äôs own environment.

## üß† Why protecting Koofr matters

Even privacy-first cloud storage like Koofr is vulnerable to risks beyond its control. Accidental deletions, silent corruption, ransomware, or account lockout can result in permanent data loss. Native versioning and sync features help, but they don‚Äôt guarantee recovery from every scenario especially when compliance, audits, or long-term retention are required.

Without immutable, externalized backups, your Koofr data remains exposed to operational mistakes and targeted attacks.

## üîì What happens when Koofr credentials leak or files are deleted?

If Koofr credentials are compromised or files are deleted whether by accident, sync error, or malware data can be lost instantly. Native recovery options may be limited by retention policies or versioning gaps, and once files are purged, recovery is often impossible.

Plakar addresses these risks by:

- Creating immutable, encrypted snapshots outside Koofr‚Äôs access scope
- Enabling offline or air-gapped backup storage for true isolation
- Allowing granular recovery of individual files or folders without full restores

Your data remains protected and restorable, even if your Koofr account is compromised or files are lost.

## üõ°Ô∏è How Plakar secures your Koofr workflows

Plakar integrates with Koofr as both a source and destination:

- **Source connector:** Import Koofr files into encrypted, deduplicated Plakar snapshots
- **Destination connector:** Store Plakar backups on Koofr for redundancy and multi-cloud resilience
- **Restore destination:** Export verified snapshots back to Koofr or other environments

Plakar adds end-to-end encryption, global deduplication, versioning, and snapshot browsing so you can inspect, verify, and restore your Koofr data on demand, even offline.

## üß∞ Everything in one tool: backup, verify, restore, browse

Plakar centralizes all your Koofr backup workflows:

- Immutable, versioned snapshots for every change
- End-to-end encryption only you hold the keys
- Deduplication to minimize storage and bandwidth
- Visual inspection and audit readiness via UI or CLI
- Cold storage export for compliance or long-term archiving

No matter how you use Koofr, Plakar ensures your data is protected, portable, and always under your control.
