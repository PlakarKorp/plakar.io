technology_description: >
  AWS S3 powers modern cloud workloads from web apps to analytics and enterprise backups.
  Its storage classes, including S3 Glacier for cold storage, offer scalable and cost-efficient data management.
  Yet misconfigured buckets, limited versioning, and lack of air‚Äëgapped backups leave data exposed.
  Plakar secures S3 with immutable, encrypted, deduplicated snapshots that remain verifiable and restorable even if the cloud account is compromised.

## üß† Why protecting Amazon S3 matters
Amazon S3 powers countless workloads from web applications to enterprise backups yet S3 buckets are often misconfigured, exposed, or unprotected. Even with features like versioning and S3 Glacier, organizations still face risks from accidental deletions, misconfigurations, or compromised IAM credentials.

## üîì What happens when Amazon S3 is compromised?
- Public or misconfigured buckets can expose sensitive data.
- Malicious users with access can delete buckets or lifecycle-managed archives.
- Cross-region or multi-account disaster recovery becomes complex without automation.

## üõ°Ô∏è How Plakar secures your Amazon S3 workflows
Plakar integrates with Amazon S3 as:
- A **source connector** to snapshot S3 buckets into encrypted, deduplicated backups
- A **restore destination** to rehydrate verified snapshots directly into S3
- A **storage backend** to host Plakar Kloset stores, leveraging S3 or S3 Glacier for cold storage

**Plakar provides end‚Äëto‚Äëend encryption, global deduplication, versioning, and snapshot browsing ensuring your S3 data remains secure, portable, and instantly recoverable across environments.**

## üß∞ Everything in one tool: backup, verify, restore, browse
Plakar unifies **backup**, **verification**, **restore**, and browsing into a single workflow, making AWS S3 not just a storage destination but a fully secured archival solution.
