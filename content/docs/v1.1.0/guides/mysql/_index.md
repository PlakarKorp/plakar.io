MySQL offers flexible backup strategies to suit different requirements. The most common approach uses `mysqldump` to create logical backups - SQL dumps that can be easily restored across different MySQL versions and platforms.

For a comprehensive understanding of MySQL backup strategies, we recommend reading the [official MySQL documentation on Backup and Recovery](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/backup-and-recovery.html).
