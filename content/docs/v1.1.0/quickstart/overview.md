Plakar is a simple, powerful backup tool designed to protect your data without the complexity. Whether you're backing up your laptop or managing infrastructure backups, Plakar makes it straightforward.

## What Makes Plakar Different?

- **Smart Storage**: Plakar automatically deduplicates your data, so backing up the same files multiple times doesn't waste space. 
- **Real Security**: Your backups are encrypted before they leave your system. Not even the storage provider can read your data.
- **Independent Snapshots**: Each backup is complete and independent. Delete old snapshots without breaking newer ones, or restore from any point in time.
- **Flexible**: Back up from filesystems, databases, cloud services, or remote servers. Restore to any destination you need.
