This section contains practical examples on showing how to deploy and use Plakar in real environments.

Each example focuses on a concrete scenario: setting up backup infrastructure, protecting specific services, or integrating Plakar with a cloud provider. The goal is not to document every option, but to show complete, working setups you can adapt to your own systems.

Examples are grouped by cloud provider or use case and can be followed independently.
