Welcome to **plakar** - easy, secure and efficient backups for people who value their time and data. The aim of this quick guide is to get you up and running with **plakar** and create your first backup within minutes. Let's get started!


## What you will need

 - an internet connection
 - a Linux, MacOS, FreeBSD or OpenBSD machine to run the software
 - admin access to install
 - sufficient local storage to store your backups
 - a web browser (for logging in and using the UI)

## Install plakar

{{< tabs name="Installing" >}}
{{% tab name="Debian-based OS"%}}
  For a Debian-based OS (e.g. Ubuntu, Debian) the easiest way is to use our apt repository.

  First, install necessary dependencies and add the repository's GPG key:
  ```bash
  apt-get update
  apt-get install -y curl sudo gnupg2
  curl -fsSL https://packages.plakar.io/keys/plakar.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/plakar.gpg
  echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/plakar.gpg] https://packages.plakar.io/deb stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/plakar.list
  ```

  Then update the package list and install plakar:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install plakar
  ```
{{< /tab >}}
{{% tab name="RPM-based OS" %}}
  For an OS which uses RPM-based packages, download the relevant '.rpm' file from the [releases page](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/releases/tag/v1.0.4).

  Then use the package manager to install the package.
  For example, on Fedora:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install plakar_1.0.4_linux_amd64.rpm
  ```

{{< /tab >}}
{{% tab name="MacOS" %}}
  The simplest way to install Plakar on macOS is with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

  Ensure you have Homebrew installed, then add the Plakar tap and install Plakar with:
  ```bash
  brew install plakarkorp/tap/plakar
  ```

  If you prefer not to use our tap, you can install from the default Homebrew repository instead with `brew install plakar`. Note that the version in the default repository may not always be the latest release.

  MacOS has some built-in protection from malware. To enable the binary to be run, you will need
  to explicitly allow it from the `Privacy & Security` settings.

{{< /tab >}}

{{% tab name="Go Install" %}}
  To install using the Go toolchain, use 'go install' with the version you want to install:
  ```bash
  $ go install github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar@v1.0.4
  ```

  This will install the binary into your `$GOPATH/bin` directory, which you may need to add to your `$PATH` if it is not already there.
{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

Verify the installation by running:
```bash
plakar version
```

This should return the expected version number, for example 'plakar/v1.0.4'.
 
## Create a Kloset store

Before we can backup any data, we need to define where the backup will go. In **plakar** terms, this storage location is called a 'Kloset Store'. You can find out more about the concept and rationale behind Kloset in [this post on our blog](https://www.plakar.io/posts/2025-04-29/kloset-the-immutable-data-store/).

For our first backup, we will create a local Kloset on the filesystem of the host OS. In a real backup scenario you would want to create a backup on a different physical device, so substitute in a better location if you have one.

> In the CLI enter the following command:
```shell
$ plakar at $HOME/backups create
```

**plakar** will then ask you to enter a passphrase, and repeat it to confirm.

{{% notice style="warning" title="Your passphrase is important!" expanded="true"  %}}

Be extra careful when choosing the passphrase:
People with access to the repository and knowledge of the passphrase can read your backups.

By default **plakar** will enforce rules on your choice of passphrase to make sure it is 
complex enough to be secure. To add complexity, use a mixture of upper and lower case 
characters and symbols.

**DO NOT LOSE OR FORGET THE PASSPHRASE:**
it is not stored anywhere and **can not** be recovered in case of loss.
A lost passphrase means the data within the repository can no longer be accessed 
or recovered.
{{% /notice %}}

## Create your first backup

Now we have created the Kloset where data will be stored we can use it to create our first backup. **plakar** uses the 'at' keyword to specify where a command is to take place. 
> To create a simple example backup, try running:
```bash
plakar at $HOME/backups backup /private/etc
```
**plakar** will process the files it finds at that location and pass them to the Kloset where they will be chunked and encrypted. 
>The output will indicate the progress:
```
9abc3294: OK ✓ /private/etc/ftpusers
9abc3294: OK ✓ /private/etc/asl/com.apple.iokit.power
9abc3294: OK ✓ /private/etc/pam.d/screensaver_new_ctk
[...]
9abc3294: OK ✓ /private/etc/apache2
9abc3294: OK ✓ /private/etc
9abc3294: OK ✓ /private
9abc3294: OK ✓ /
backup: created unsigned snapshot 9abc3294 of size 3.1 MB in 72.55875ms
```
>The output lists the short form of the snapshot's id number. This is used to identify a particular snapshot and is also how you identify the snapshot to use for various **plakar** commands.

{{% notice style="info" title="Command help" expanded="true" %}}
Learning new tools can be confusing. To make things easier, **plakar** includes built-in help for all commands. Just use `plakar help` and then the command you need help with for a full list of options and examples. For example, if you forget what the options are for restoring files from a snapshot: `plakar help restore`

{{% /notice %}}

> You can verify that the backup exists:

```bash
$ plakar at $HOME/backups ls
```

>...will return the known backups in that Kloset:
```
2025-09-02T15:38:16Z   9abc3294    3.1 MB      0s   /private/etc
```

The output lists the datestamp of the last backup, the short UUID, the size of files backed-up, the time it took to create the backup and the source path of the backup.

> Verify the integrity of the contents:

```bash
$ plakar at $HOME/backups check 9abc3294
```
```
9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc/afpovertcp.cfg
9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-autoindex.conf
9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-dav.conf
[...]
9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc/xtab
9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc/zshrc
9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc/zshrc_Apple_Terminal
9abc3294: ✓ /private/etc
check: verification of 9abc3294:/private/etc completed successfully
```

> And restore it to a local directory:

```bash
$ plakar at $HOME/backups restore -to /tmp/restore 9abc3294
```

In this case we are restoring to temporary storage as it is just a test. The output will list the restored files as it creates them:

```
9abc3294: OK ✓ /private/etc/afpovertcp.cfg
9abc3294: OK ✓ /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-autoindex.conf
9abc3294: OK ✓ /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-dav.conf
[...]
9abc3294: OK ✓ /private/etc/xtab
9abc3294: OK ✓ /private/etc/zprofile
9abc3294: OK ✓ /private/etc/zshrc
9abc3294: OK ✓ /private/etc/zshrc_Apple_Terminal
restore: restoration of 9abc3294:/private/etc at /tmp/restore completed successfully
```

> To verify the files have been re-created, list the directory they were restored to:

```
$ ls -l /tmp/restore
```

This will list the restored file. Note that the properties of the restored files, such as the creation date, will be the same as the original files that were backed up:

```

## Login

By default, **plakar** works without requiring you to create an account or log in. You can back up and restore your data with just a few commands, no external services involved.

However, logging in unlocks optional features that improve usability and monitoring, and by adding the ability to easily install pre-built integrations. In plakar, an integration is a package which supports an additional protocol as a source, destination or storage method (or all three), such as ftp, Google Cloud Storage or an s3 bucket.

Logging in is simple and needs only an email address or github account for authentication.

> To log in using the CLI:
```
plakar login -email <youremailaddress@example.com>
```

Substitute in your own email address and follow the prompt. You can then check your email and follow the link sent from plakar.io. 
>To check that you are now logged in you can run:

```
plakar login -status
```

## Access the UI

> Plakar provides a web interface to view the backups and their content. To start the web interface, run:

```bash
$ plakar at $HOME/backups ui
```

Your default browser will open a new tab. You can navigate through the snapshots, search and view the files, and download them.
