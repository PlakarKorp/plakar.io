# What's plakar ?

`plakar` is a **free** and [opensource](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar) utility to create
**distributed**, **versioned** **backups** with **compression**, **encryption** and data **deduplication**.

With a very clear goal to simplify backups,
it is designed to be **straightforward** to use.
It requires a few seconds to install and only a few minutes to get backups set up and running:
creating a backup is as simple as typing `plakar backup` and restoring as simple as typing `plakar restore`.

`plakar` is written in [Golang](https://go.dev),
developed primarily on [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/) and [OpenBSD](https://www.OpenBSD.org),
tested on several [Linux](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) systems,
and should work on most modern Unix-like system.


## How does it work ?

**Data collection:** Plakar scans and collects data from specified sources, such as directories or files, that need to be backed up.

**Deduplication:** As it processes data, Plakar identifies and removes duplicate chunks of data. This means only unique data is stored, reducing the overall storage requirements.

**Compression:** The unique data chunks are then compressed to save even more space.

**Encryption:** After compression, the data is encrypted to ensure security and privacy. This step makes sure that only authorized users can access the backed-up data.

**Storage Management:** Plakar stores the processed data in a structured repository. It keeps track of metadata and versions, allowing users to efficiently access, restore, and manage backups.

**Restoration:** When needed, Plakar can restore files or directories from the backup repository. Since it knows the structure and contents of each backup, it can quickly rebuild the requested data.

This design makes Plakar efficient in terms of storage and performance, while also providing strong data security and integrity.
