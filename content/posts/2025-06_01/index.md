Hello everyone,

Just a quick blog post to let you know that we have just released a new minor version of plakar,
`v1.0.2`, a very small incremental update over the latest stable release that happened early May.

> Why do we want to make such a small release ?

Well,
a huge improvement in S3 performances and memory consumption was too nice to delay further,
considering it is quite a common use case.

## What's in that release ?

Nothing too big but four fixes,
two being interesting enough for our community that we want them available to all as soon as possible.


### Security check

Plakar can now check the [releases atom feed](https://plakar.io/api/releases.atom) of our project and warn you if a newer release carries a `reliability` or `security` fix that you should **_really_** install.

![That's if you feel adventurous :-)](nestorjones.png)

We think it's a good option to have for most users,
but if you're not comfortable with this check,
you can turn it off permanently using `plakar -disable-security-check` and live on your own adventurous path.




### Fix for relative pathnames through agent

We spotted a small bug when using relative paths _for a repository_ through the agent.

Plakar has no problem resolving relative paths for backups,
however if the path of the repository was relative **_AND_** the CLI was executed from a directory different than the agent,
then the CWD was incorrectly resolved and the relative path resolution failed.

For example, `plakar at ./foobar backup` could mean `/tmp/foobar` on the CLI but `~gilles/foobar` on the agent.

This is now fixed !

### S3 speed improvements

We have identified a better way for our importer to iterate over "directories" in S3 buckets.

Long story short,
in S3 there's no concept of directories:
we use the `/` character as a path separator and pretend that it creates nested objects when they are really flat at the top level.

What was overseen is that the _minio_ client supports a `recursive` option in its listing function...
that does all this pretending that directories exist at a better level than us.
This drastically improves the performances of listing resources.

In his test case,
he observed an impressive `x60` performance boost on a backup over S3,
reducing a backup that took **~14 minutes** to **~13 seconds**.

This by itself was worthy of a minor release :-)


### S3 memory improvements

One of our users,
[@anbcorp](https://github.com/Anbcorp) reported an OOM kill when doing backups.

We setup a few tests and quickly identified that it only affected the S3 storage backend,
but oddly enough it didn't trigger on my machine or that of another developer.
It only took a few minutes of profiling to figure out what was happening:

When we do not know the size of a file,
the `minio` client library does a big allocation (512MB).
The problem is that not only do we not know the size of some files before they are pushed,
but we also parallelize quite a bit,
leading the client library to perform a lot of big allocations.

This isn't an issue when you have a few number of cores (low parallelism) or a large amount of memory (can handle the big allocations),
but if you have a large number of cores and low memory (that was @anbcorp's case),
you end up parallelizing a large number of huge allocations until you get terminated.

This only affects one specific call in the storage backend,
which is the only one where we don't know the size of files and use heavy parallelization,
but we found a fix that solves this issue and manages to avoid the code path that does the big allocations.

This was confirmed to fix the issue,
and was also by itself a good reason to make a minor release.

## What's next ?

We'll be talking about the capabilities of PTAR,
our own archiving format,
very soon on this blog.

Stay tuned !
