## TL;DR:
We recently introduced our [ptar archive format](/posts/2025-06-27/it-doesnt-make-sense-to-wrap-modern-data-in-a-1979-format-introducing-.ptar/) and the feedback was good,
but many people felt like this was too tied to the plakar backup solution:
if you just want to use a deduplicated archive solution, why should you install a full backup software ?

Today,
we unveil `kapsul`,
an **ISC-licensed open-source** tool dedicated to creating and consuming ptar archives.
It only does a subset of what `plakar` does,
but has less requirements and an even simpler interface with zero configuration and no need for an agent.

This short post tells you all you need to know to get started testing it.

## What Is `kapsul` ?

The `kapsul` utility allows creating ptar archives,
_aka. capsules_,
that contain deduplicated, compressed, content-addressed, strongly encrypted data.

What sets it apart from `plakar`,
is that by accepting a trade-off and not supporting _some_ of the features that `plakar` does,
`kapsul` can be implemented as an agentless and zero-configuration tool.

In other words:
you install,
you run,
it works right away.

```
$ go install github.com/PlakarKorp/kapsul@v0.0.0-beta.10
go: downloading github.com/PlakarKorp/kapsul v0.0.0-beta.10

$ kapsul -f /tmp/bleh.ptar create /private/etc 
repository passphrase: 
repository passphrase (confirm): 

$ kapsul -f /tmp/bleh.ptar ls                 
repository passphrase: 
2025-07-07T21:51:57Z   bff68fc7    3.1 MB        0s /private/etc
```

With just these three commands,
you go from nothing to a `/tmp/bleh.ptar` that has all of these properties (shameless copy-paste from previous article):

- **Immutable** — it is write-once, tamper-evident by design.
- **Deduplicated** — it is content-addressed, chunks are referenced multiple times.
- **Compressed** — it has post-deduplication compression to save more space.
- **Encrypted** — it uses same [audited model](/posts/2025-02-28/audit-of-plakar-cryptography/) as underlying Kloset store.
- **Versioned** — it supports granular inspection of previous states.
- **Browsable** — it support browsing via CLI or UI, without full extraction.
- **(Trans)Portable** — it works on a USB stick, offline machine, or tape.

## So What Are The Trade-Offs ?

To be zero-config AND agent-less,
`kapsul` only supports a limited set of integrations and does not have the same level of caching as `plakar` to accelerate the processing of previously archived data.

Long story short,
it can archive data coming from the local filesystem,
a remote SFTP,
`stdin` and another `.ptar` archive (we will soon extend to other archive formats to allow conversions into `.ptar`).

While `kapsul` is simpler,
it does not support advanced features like remote read-write targets,
custom scheduling,
or complex caching mechanisms that `plakar` provides.
If you need more granular control over your backup process or advanced features,
`plakar` might still be the better fit.

---

## What Can I Do With It ?

That's the nicest part.

_MOST_ of what `plakar` can do... `kapsul` can do.

You can craft a ptar,
list or display its content,
launch a `ui`,
preview files (including medias), ...

and some of the commands that are currently not supported,
like `mount` and the like,
are going to be implemented in the next few weeks providing very powerful capabilities to `kapsul`.


Oooooh,
and maybe I'm the only one finding that cool,
but...


It even supports accessing a remote `ptar` over http/https for random access fetching.
Accessing a remote .ptar over HTTP/HTTPS allows you to fetch specific parts of an archive without downloading it in full:

```
$ kapsul -f https://poolp.org/test.ptar ls
2025-06-02T19:43:53Z   ed0f6603    3.1 MB        0s /private/etc

$ kapsul -f https://poolp.org/test.ptar ui
```

All of the commands that work on a local archive can be used on a remote one,
and will transparently use optimized random accesses so the archive is never fetched fully.

## Conclusion

A week ago,
we released `ptar` as a `plakar` subcommand and some people thought it should be a separate tool.
A week later,
you have a new standalone tool, `kapsul`, that's ISC-licensed, open-source, free,
and that lets you build your own little secure vaults in seconds.

In case we need to state the obvious,
we care about users <3
