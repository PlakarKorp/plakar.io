Today marks a significant step forward for our project and our community. We are thrilled to announce that Plakar has officially joined the **Linux Foundation** and the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)** as a member. This is an important milestone in our mission to establish an Open Standard for Resilience.

We founded Plakar with a specific DNA: a convergence of hyperscale operations and uncompromising security engineering, rooted in the OpenBSD philosophy. By joining these foundations, we commit to bringing this rigor to the global Open Source ecosystem. We believe that true resilience relies on transparency. You cannot claim to secure critical infrastructure if the format protecting your data remains a proprietary secret or a black box.

This membership is not just a formality; it strengthens our pledge to three core principles that drive our engineering every day.

* **Radical Openness:** The format storing your data must be open, documented, and built to outlive the tools that created it. We are moving away from proprietary silos to a portable, content-addressed primitive.
* **Zero-Trust by Design:** In an adversarial environment, security cannot be an afterthought. Our core engine, Kloset, and our archive format, PTAR, are designed to ensure you never have to trust the infrastructure with your encryption keys.
* **Ecosystem Integration:** We are joining the table to collaborate with the industry leaders. Our goal is to ensure Plakar integrates seamlessly with the cloud-native stack, bridging the gap between modern workloads and traditional infrastructure without friction.

We are building the critical last line of defense, and we are doing it in the open. This membership is a promise that Plakar will evolve with the strict governance and transparency required by the modern cloud-native stack. We invite every developer, engineer, and operator to be part of this journey.

Join the movement on **GitHub** and **Discord**

With **love**. ❤️

The Plakar team
