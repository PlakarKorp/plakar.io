To celebrate this momentum on the final day of 2025, we are incredibly proud to announce the immediate availability of Plakar Enterprise for AWS. As the year draws to a close, the Plakar team looks back with immense pride on twelve months of exceptional velocity. In less than a year, we have transitioned from an ambitious vision to a proven technical reality.

## Why we think legacy backup is broken

We founded Plakar based on a critical observation: traditional backup architectures have hit a structural dead end. With data volumes exploding, often doubling every three to four years, and end-to-end encryption becoming non-negotiable to counter ransomware and massive data leaks, legacy tools are failing.

They cannot maintain storage efficiency once data is encrypted, forcing enterprises into an impossible choice between security and cost. Furthermore, the fragmentation of data across on-premise, cloud, and SaaS environments has created a dangerous blind spot in governance, leaving IT leaders unsure of what is truly protected.

## How we spent 2025: Solving the efficiency paradox

We dedicated 2025 to solving this impossible equation. Our engineering teams developed **Kloset**, our open-source storage engine, and **PTAR**, our universal archive format.

These technologies finally reconcile high-density storage efficiency with zero-knowledge encryption, ensuring data is never exposed in plain text to the infrastructure, while guaranteeing instant access to data for advanced usage and efficient restore. This technical rigor has united a vibrant community of 600 engineers on Discord around several open source releases, whose feedback has been vital in validating our assumptions and hardening our product.

## Our vision for a new Open Standard

Our mission remains unchanged: to establish the new Open Standard for Data Resilience. We are not just building another backup tool; we are decoupling data protection from the underlying storage infrastructure.

Our promise is simple, "Backup anything. Store anywhere. Restore everywhere," while guaranteeing that resilience operations can be delegated to third parties, whether internal or external to your company, without ever surrendering access to your data.

## A major milestone: Bringing Plakar to AWS

The release of Plakar Enterprise for AWS marks a major milestone toward this vision. Designed as a hardened virtual appliance, this version acts as a layer of intelligence and unified governance.

It enables enterprises to secure their native AWS environments while maintaining total visibility and agnostic control over their resilience posture, effectively bridging the governance gap that threatens large infrastructures.


### Join the beta and help us shape the future

Starting today, the Enterprise version is available on the AWS Marketplace in closed beta.

We invite our community, our first clients, and our strategic Design Partners to **contact us to gain access** before a public version is released during January. We are eager to hear your feedback to continue refining our standard.

This launch is just the beginning; numerous new features are expected in the coming weeks for both the Enterprise and Community versions, accelerating our transition from a single tool into a comprehensive Resilience-as-a-Service ecosystem. We are also actively working on expanding our cloud footprint: versions for other providers will follow rapidly, with **OVHcloud** and **GCP** next in line.
