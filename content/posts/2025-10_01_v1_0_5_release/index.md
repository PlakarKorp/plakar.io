Hot on the heels of v1.0.4, weâ€™re excited to ship **Plakar v1.0.5** â€” a release packed with **build refinements**, **pipeline tuning**, **hook support for backups**, and **smaller but meaningful quality-of-life updates** across the board.  

This version sets the stage for smoother integrations, better developer ergonomics, and more flexible automation.

## Build & Packaging Improvements

Weâ€™ve improved the **build process** to make distribution cleaner and more robust:

- âœ… **Fixed Homebrew packaging** to ensure a smooth experience on macOS ([#1684](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1684))  
- ðŸªŸ **Added Windows builds** for broader platform support ([#1685](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1685))  
- ðŸ“¦ Multiple dependency bumps, including:
  - `golang.org/x/tools`, `golang.org/x/mod`
  - `google.golang.org/grpc`
  - `github.com/spf13/viper`
  - `github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea`
  - `github.com/go-playground/validator/v10`

These changes ensure a more consistent, up-to-date development environment across all platforms.

## UI & Documentation Updates

- New **social links** and **documentation references** have been added ([#1706](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1706)).  
- **Plakar UI** has been synced to the latest `main@4a02561` revision ([#1710](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1710)), with simplified asset serving ([#1718](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1718)).  
- CI was fixed to properly update the UI as part of the build ([#1709](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1709)).  
- Manual pages were enhanced to better describe the `import` command ([#1730](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1730)).

Together, these improvements polish the interface and documentation, making Plakar more accessible and discoverable.

---

## Pipeline & Concurrency Tuning

Since turning backup into a **pipeline**, weâ€™ve adjusted concurrency levels to better align with the new architecture ([#1713](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1713)).  

This change improves stability and resource usage during heavy operations, paving the way for further optimizations in future versions.

---

## Backup Hooks & Sync Enhancements

A key new feature in v1.0.5 is **hook support for backup commands**:

- Added **pre-hook** and **post-hook** CLI flags to `plakar backup` ([#1727](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1727))  
- Hooks now work seamlessly on **Windows** too ([#1741](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1741))  
- Added **fail hooks**, allowing users to trigger custom actions when backups fail ([#1743](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1743))  
- Introduced support for `passphrase_cmd` during sync operations ([#1744](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1744))

These additions unlock more powerful automation and integration scenarios, letting you plug Plakar more deeply into existing workflows.

---

## Maintenance & Internal Refinements

Other notable changes include:

- **Improved type safety** in `DecodeRPC` ([#1721](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1721))  
- Clearer messaging around **grace periods** ([#1717](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1717))  
- Better **login requirement clarifications** ([#1715](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1715))  
- Enhanced handling for **missing locations** ([#1716](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1716))  
- Removed unused code paths and simplified plugin arguments ([#1724](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1724), [#1726](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1726), [#1729](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1729))  
- Added a `cache-mem-size` parameter for finer cache control ([#1738](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1738))  
- Miscellaneous bug fixes, including proper error handling for missing stores ([#1725](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1725)) and filter overrides ([#1737](https://github.com/PlakarKorp/plakar/pull/1737))

These refinements make the codebase leaner, more predictable, and easier to maintain.
