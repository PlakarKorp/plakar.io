&lt;p>Cloud sync is not backup. OneDriveâ€™s convenience can mask risks: silent corruption, accidental deletion, ransomware, or compromised credentials can lead to rapid, irreversible data loss. Retention and version history help, but theyâ€™re not enough for compliance, audit, or long-term recovery. Without immutable, externalized backups, your files remain vulnerable to threats that propagate faster than you can react.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="-what-happens-when-onedrive-is-compromised">ðŸ”“ What happens when OneDrive is compromised?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If files are deleted locally, OneDrive syncs those deletions to the cloud sometimes before you notice. Ransomware or malware can encrypt files and sync the damage across all devices. A breach of your Microsoft account can expose or wipe entire libraries. Native recovery options are limited by retention windows and version history, which may not cover every scenario.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
