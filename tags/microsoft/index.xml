&lt;p>OneDrive&amp;rsquo;s seamless integration with Microsoft 365 makes it indispensable for modern work, but this same integration creates unique risks. When something goes wrong—whether accidental deletion, file corruption, or ransomware—the problem spreads instantly across every connected device and user. This leaves OneDrive environments vulnerable to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Synchronized Deletions&lt;/strong>: A file deleted on one device disappears from OneDrive and all other devices within seconds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Rapid Corruption Spread&lt;/strong>: Corrupted or maliciously encrypted files replace healthy versions across your entire organization.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Credential-Based Attacks&lt;/strong>: A single compromised account can be used to delete or encrypt large portions of your shared files.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>While OneDrive provides a recycle bin and version history, these features have time limits and may not protect against determined attackers or cascading failures. For regulated industries or business-critical data, these built-in protections are insufficient.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
