&lt;p>Email is often treated as inherently persistent, but IMAP mailboxes are vulnerable to both accidental and malicious data loss. Standard IMAP setups face several critical risks:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Accidental Deletion&lt;/strong>: Users can permanently delete entire folders with a few clicks. Most mail clients offer no meaningful undo beyond a trash folder that itself can be emptied.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Account Compromise&lt;/strong>: If credentials are stolen or phished, attackers can delete years of correspondence instantly. Business email compromise attacks specifically target mailboxes to destroy evidence or communication history.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Retention Policy Gaps&lt;/strong>: Server-side policies may automatically delete old messages. Quota pressures can force users to delete important emails. These deletions happen silently and often without adequate warning.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Synchronization Cascades&lt;/strong>: IMAP synchronizes deletions across all connected devices immediately. A mistake on one device propagates everywhere, leaving no local copy to recover from.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>No Version History&lt;/strong>: Unlike documents or files, emails have no built-in versioning. Once modified or deleted on the server, the original is gone unless you have an independent backup.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Emails often contain business records, compliance data, legal correspondence, or irreplaceable personal history and relying solely on the mail server is not enough. You need verifiable, immutable snapshots that exist independently of your IMAP account.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
