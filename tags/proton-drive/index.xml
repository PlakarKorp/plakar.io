&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This integration allows you to snapshot and restore Proton Drive data using Plakar to store it in a Kloset store, while minimizing storage usage and ensuring strong data security.
It includes a Storage Connector that lets you persist snapshots to Proton Drive itself, either from Proton Drive or from other sources.
A Viewer is also provided to inspect, search, and restore snapshots without requiring full extraction.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Proton Drive</title><link>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/protondrive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/protondrive/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="why-protecting-proton-drive-matters">Why protecting Proton Drive matters&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Proton Drive provides strong privacy through end-to-end encryption, but like any cloud storage platform, it faces risks from accidental deletion, device compromise, and sync propagation:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Instant Deletion&lt;/strong>: If you or a collaborator accidentally delete a folder, that deletion spreads to every synced device immediately.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Limited Recovery Window&lt;/strong>: Proton Drive provides a trash retention period, but if data loss is discovered after that window closes, those files may be permanently gone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ransomware&lt;/strong>: If your local files are encrypted by malware, Proton Drive will sync those corrupted versions, overwriting your healthy data in the cloud.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For important documents and sensitive files, an independent backup provides an additional safety layer that remains available regardless of what happens in your live Proton Drive environment.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
