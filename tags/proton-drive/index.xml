&lt;p>Cloud sync and encryption protect privacy, but not against all risks. Files in Proton Drive can be lost to accidental deletion, overwritten by malware, or permanently removed after trash expiry. Account lockouts or credential loss can make data inaccessible, and compliance needs often require more than basic retention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Without immutable backups, recovery from these scenarios is unreliable or impossible.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="-what-happens-when-proton-drive-files-are-deleted-or-compromised">ðŸ”“ What happens when Proton Drive files are deleted or compromised?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If files are deleted intentionally or by mistake across synced devices, or if ransomware overwrites originals, Proton Driveâ€™s native features may not help. Trash expiry or account suspension can make recovery impossible, and sync can propagate errors instantly.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
