&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This integration allows you to snapshot and restore iCloud Drive data using Plakar to store it in a Kloset store, while minimizing storage usage and ensuring strong data security.
It includes a Storage Connector that lets you persist snapshots to iCloud Drive itself, either from iCloud Drive or from other sources.
A Viewer is also provided to inspect, search, and restore snapshots without requiring full extraction.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OpenDrive integration documentation</title><link>https://www.plakar.io/docs/main/integrations/opendrive/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.plakar.io/docs/main/integrations/opendrive/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="integration-package-opendrive">Integration Package: OpenDrive&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>This integration allows you to snapshot and restore OpenDrive data using Plakar to store it in a Kloset store, while minimizing storage usage and ensuring strong data security.
It includes a Storage Connector that lets you persist snapshots to OpenDrive itself, either from OpenDrive or from other sources.
A Viewer is also provided to inspect, search, and restore snapshots without requiring full extraction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Use cases:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Cold backup of OpenDrive folders&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Long-term archiving and disaster recovery&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Portable export and vendor escape to other platforms&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>iCloud Drive syncs files across all your Apple devices, but sync is not backup. If files are deleted, corrupted, or compromised, those changes propagate everywhere instantly. Without immutable backups, you risk silent data loss, ransomware spread, or compliance failures, and recovery options are limited or unavailable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="-what-happens-when-icloud-drive-files-are-deleted-or-compromised">ðŸ”“ What happens when iCloud Drive files are deleted or compromised?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A mistaken deletion, malware infection, or stolen credentials can wipe or corrupt your files across every device. Native versioning is limited and often hidden, making recovery unreliable. If you need to restore a specific version or recover from a major incident, iCloud Drive alone cannot guarantee data integrity or rollback.
Icloud can be backed up by Apple but it is not free and after 180 days it is deleted, and it does not provide the level of control and security that Plakar offers.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
