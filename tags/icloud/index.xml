&lt;p>iCloud Drive syncs files across all your Apple devices, but sync is not backup. If files are deleted, corrupted, or compromised, those changes propagate everywhere instantly. Without immutable backups, you risk silent data loss, ransomware spread, or compliance failures, and recovery options are limited or unavailable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="-what-happens-when-icloud-drive-files-are-deleted-or-compromised">🔓 What happens when iCloud Drive files are deleted or compromised?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A mistaken deletion, malware infection, or stolen credentials can wipe or corrupt your files across every device. Native versioning is limited and often hidden, making recovery unreliable. If you need to restore a specific version or recover from a major incident, iCloud Drive alone cannot guarantee data integrity or rollback.
Icloud can be backed up by Apple but it is not free and after 180 days it is deleted, and it does not provide the level of control and security that Plakar offers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CalDAV</title><link>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/caldav/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/caldav/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="why-protecting-caldav-matters">Why protecting CalDAV matters&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Calendar data has become a critical infrastructure for personal and professional life. Meetings, appointments, deadlines, and event history represent important scheduling information that organizations and individuals depend on daily.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CalDAV provides reliable synchronization across devices, but synchronization is not the same as backup. Standard CalDAV usage faces several risks:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Accidental Deletion&lt;/strong>: Events can be permanently deleted across all synchronized devices instantly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Limited Recovery&lt;/strong>: Most providers offer minimal version history or trash functionality with short retention windows.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Calendar Corruption&lt;/strong>: Malformed events or sync errors can corrupt entire calendars.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="security-and-compromise">Security and Compromise&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>CalDAV servers are accessed via account credentials and application-specific passwords. If credentials are compromised or permissions are misconfigured, your calendar data is vulnerable:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
