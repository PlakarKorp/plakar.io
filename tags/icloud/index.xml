&lt;p>iCloud Drive is central to the Apple ecosystem, seamlessly syncing files across devices, however synchronization doesn&amp;rsquo;t count as a backup solution. Actions taken in iCloud Drive are synced to all connected devices almost instantly. This leaves it vulnerable to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Accidental Deletion&lt;/strong>: Files removed by a user are quickly removed across all devices.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Overwrites and Corruption&lt;/strong>: Bad edits or corrupted files replace healthy versions across the entire environment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ransomware&lt;/strong>: Malware-encrypted files are synchronized back to iCloud Drive, overwriting clean data.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Native retention and recovery options are limited in scope and duration. While Apple provides some version history, it&amp;rsquo;s restricted to recent changes and specific file types. For business-critical or compliance-sensitive data, an independent and immutable backup history is essential.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CalDAV</title><link>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/caldav/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/caldav/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="why-protecting-caldav-matters">Why protecting CalDAV matters&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Calendar data has become a critical infrastructure for personal and professional life. Meetings, appointments, deadlines, and event history represent important scheduling information that organizations and individuals depend on daily.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CalDAV provides reliable synchronization across devices, but synchronization is not the same as backup. Standard CalDAV usage faces several risks:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Accidental Deletion&lt;/strong>: Events can be permanently deleted across all synchronized devices instantly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Limited Recovery&lt;/strong>: Most providers offer minimal version history or trash functionality with short retention windows.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Calendar Corruption&lt;/strong>: Malformed events or sync errors can corrupt entire calendars.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="security-and-compromise">Security and Compromise&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>CalDAV servers are accessed via account credentials and application-specific passwords. If credentials are compromised or permissions are misconfigured, your calendar data is vulnerable:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
