&lt;p>Google Drive is trusted for everyday work and collaboration, but its convenience can mask real risks. Data can be silently corrupted, deleted by mistake, or encrypted by ransomware often with sync propagating the issue instantly across all devices and users. Native retention and recovery options are limited, and compliance needs may go unmet without immutable, verifiable backups.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="-what-happens-when-google-drive-is-compromised-or-data-is-lost">ðŸ”“ What happens when Google Drive is compromised or data is lost?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If your Google Drive credentials are leaked, or files are deleted or overwritten whether by accident, malware, or sync error data can vanish instantly across all connected devices. Googleâ€™s trash and retention policies offer only short-term protection, and recovery is not guaranteed.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
