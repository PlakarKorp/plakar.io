&lt;p>SFTP is a standard for secure file transfers across Linux servers, BSD hosts, and NAS devices like Synology and QNAP. However, secure transfer is not the same as a backup strategy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While SFTP secures the data in transit, it does not protect the data once it arrives to where you want to store it. Standard SFTP setups face several risks:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Lack of Versioning&lt;/strong>: Files can be overwritten or deleted immediately after upload.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>No Immutability&lt;/strong>: There are no permanent snapshots to revert to if a file is corrupted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Operational Risk&lt;/strong>: Manual transfers or custom scripts are error-prone and difficult to audit.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>When compliance, uptime, or disaster recovery is critical, simply storing files on SFTP is not enough. You need verifiable, immutable backups that can survive mistakes, misconfigurations, or attacks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stdio</title><link>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/stdio/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/stdio/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="why-use-streams-instead-of-files">Why use Streams instead of Files?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Plakar’s Stdio integration can back up any data stream provided via stdin like database dumps, system logs, command output or custom scripts. Unlike workflows that first create an intermediate files, streaming data directly avoids several challenges:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Storage Waste&lt;/strong>: You need enough free space to hold the uncompressed export before it even gets to your backup tool.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Security Risks&lt;/strong>: Temporary files often sit on your disk unencrypted while waiting to be backed up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Complexity&lt;/strong>: You have to manage the creation and deletion of these intermediate files.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>With the Stdio integration, Plakar reads data as it’s generated, encrypts and deduplicates it, and streams it straight to your Kloset Store without creating any intermediate files on disk.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tar</title><link>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/tar/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/tar/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="using-tar-archives-with-plakar">Using tar archives with Plakar&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Tar has been a standard Unix archive format for decades, commonly used to bundle files for distribution, transfer, and simple backups. It is widely supported and highly portable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tar archives themselves do not provide backup semantics such as deduplication, version tracking, or built-in encryption. Managing backups as collections of independent tar files becomes difficult as data evolves over time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tar archives are imported into Plakar, which handles storage, deduplication, and verification.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
