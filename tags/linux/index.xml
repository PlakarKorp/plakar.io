&lt;p>SFTP is a standard for secure file transfers across Linux servers, BSD hosts, and NAS devices like Synology and QNAP. However, secure transfer is not the same as a backup strategy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While SFTP secures the data in transit, it does not protect the data once it arrives to where you want to store it. Standard SFTP setups face several risks:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Lack of Versioning&lt;/strong>: Files can be overwritten or deleted immediately after upload.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>No Immutability&lt;/strong>: There are no permanent snapshots to revert to if a file is corrupted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Operational Risk&lt;/strong>: Manual transfers or custom scripts are error-prone and difficult to audit.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>When compliance, uptime, or disaster recovery is critical, simply storing files on SFTP is not enough. You need verifiable, immutable backups that can survive mistakes, misconfigurations, or attacks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tar</title><link>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/tar/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/tar/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="using-tar-archives-with-plakar">Using tar archives with Plakar&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Tar has been a standard Unix archive format for decades, commonly used to bundle files for distribution, transfer, and simple backups. It is widely supported and highly portable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tar archives themselves do not provide backup semantics such as deduplication, version tracking, or built-in encryption. Managing backups as collections of independent tar files becomes difficult as data evolves over time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tar archives are imported into Plakar, which handles storage, deduplication, and verification.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
