&lt;p>S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a highly available and durable object storage service used to store arbitrary data as discrete objects in buckets. S3 is offered by AWS, and compatible implementations are available via software such as MinIO, Ceph RGW, Wasabi, and Scality Zenko. It is ideal for storing backups, media archives, logs, and large data sets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With Plakar, you can ingest data from S3 buckets into immutable, encrypted snapshots that are verifiable and portable. You can also use S3 as a target repository to store backups created from any source.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
