&lt;p>Most of us protect our files by simply copying them to an external drive or a USB stick. While having a second copy is a good start, it isn&amp;rsquo;t a real backup strategy. Standard file copying leaves your data vulnerable to a few common problems:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Accidental Deletion&lt;/strong>: If you delete a file by mistake and your sync tool mirrors that change, the file is gone from both places.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ransomware and Corruption&lt;/strong>: If your files are hit by malware or a disk failure, &amp;ldquo;copying&amp;rdquo; those files usually just preserves the damaged versions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Human Error&lt;/strong>: It is incredibly easy to overwrite a new version of a document with an old one during a manual move.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For your personal photos, system settings, or work projects, you need a way to go back to a specific version of your data that you know is safe and healthy in case of a mishap with your current data.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
