&lt;p>SFTP is a standard for secure file transfers across Linux servers, BSD hosts, and NAS devices like Synology and QNAP. However, secure transfer is not the same as a backup strategy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While SFTP secures the data in transit, it does not protect the data once it arrives to where you want to store it. Standard SFTP setups face several risks:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Lack of Versioning&lt;/strong>: Files can be overwritten or deleted immediately after upload.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>No Immutability&lt;/strong>: There are no permanent snapshots to revert to if a file is corrupted.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Operational Risk&lt;/strong>: Manual transfers or custom scripts are error-prone and difficult to audit.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>When compliance, uptime, or disaster recovery is critical, simply storing files on SFTP is not enough. You need verifiable, immutable backups that can survive mistakes, misconfigurations, or attacks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dropbox</title><link>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/dropbox/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/dropbox/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="-why-protecting-dropbox-matters">🧠 Why protecting Dropbox matters&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Dropbox syncs and shares files instantly, but sync is not backup. Accidental deletions, ransomware, or sync errors can propagate across all devices, leading to permanent data loss. Dropbox’s retention policies are limited, and recovery options may not meet compliance or audit requirements. Without immutable, externalized backups, your Dropbox data remains vulnerable to silent corruption, overwrites, or account compromise.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="-what-happens-when-dropbox-is-compromised-or-data-is-lost">🔓 What happens when Dropbox is compromised or data is lost?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If Dropbox credentials are leaked, ransomware encrypts files, or a user accidentally deletes critical data, the problem can spread rapidly across all linked devices and users. Native Dropbox recovery is limited by trash expiry and retention windows, and may not cover all scenarios. Once data is gone or corrupted, recovery is often impossible without a separate backup.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Google Drive</title><link>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/googledrive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/googledrive/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="-why-protecting-google-drive-matters">🧠 Why protecting Google Drive matters&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Google Drive is trusted for everyday work and collaboration, but its convenience can mask real risks. Data can be silently corrupted, deleted by mistake, or encrypted by ransomware often with sync propagating the issue instantly across all devices and users. Native retention and recovery options are limited, and compliance needs may go unmet without immutable, verifiable backups.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="-what-happens-when-google-drive-is-compromised-or-data-is-lost">🔓 What happens when Google Drive is compromised or data is lost?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If your Google Drive credentials are leaked, or files are deleted or overwritten whether by accident, malware, or sync error data can vanish instantly across all connected devices. Google’s trash and retention policies offer only short-term protection, and recovery is not guaranteed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>iCloud Drive</title><link>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/iclouddrive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/iclouddrive/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="-why-protecting-icloud-drive-matters">🧠 Why protecting iCloud Drive matters&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>iCloud Drive syncs files across all your Apple devices, but sync is not backup. If files are deleted, corrupted, or compromised, those changes propagate everywhere instantly. Without immutable backups, you risk silent data loss, ransomware spread, or compliance failures, and recovery options are limited or unavailable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="-what-happens-when-icloud-drive-files-are-deleted-or-compromised">🔓 What happens when iCloud Drive files are deleted or compromised?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A mistaken deletion, malware infection, or stolen credentials can wipe or corrupt your files across every device. Native versioning is limited and often hidden, making recovery unreliable. If you need to restore a specific version or recover from a major incident, iCloud Drive alone cannot guarantee data integrity or rollback.
Icloud can be backed up by Apple but it is not free and after 180 days it is deleted, and it does not provide the level of control and security that Plakar offers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Koofr</title><link>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/koofr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/koofr/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="-why-protecting-koofr-matters">🧠 Why protecting Koofr matters&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Even privacy-first cloud storage like Koofr is vulnerable to risks beyond its control. Accidental deletions, silent corruption, ransomware, or account lockout can result in permanent data loss. Native versioning and sync features help, but they don’t guarantee recovery from every scenario especially when compliance, audits, or long-term retention are required.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Without immutable, externalized backups, your Koofr data remains exposed to operational mistakes and targeted attacks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MinIO</title><link>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/minio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/minio/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="why-protecting-minio-matters">Why protecting MinIO matters&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Object storage is often perceived as durable by default, but durability is not the same as a backup. Many organizations use MinIO to store logs, datasets, container images, or even other backup files, assuming they are safe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, without independent immutability and integrity validation, data stored in MinIO is still vulnerable to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Silent Corruption&lt;/strong>: Data can degrade over time without being noticed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Accidental Deletion&lt;/strong>: Misconfigured lifecycle policies can delete important data automatically.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Access Mismanagement&lt;/strong>: If security keys are leaked or misused, your entire data store can be wiped or altered.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>When retention and recovery are mission-critical, simply storing objects is not enough. You need a verifiable backup strategy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OneDrive</title><link>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/onedrive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/onedrive/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="-why-protecting-onedrive-matters">🧠 Why protecting OneDrive matters&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cloud sync is not backup. OneDrive’s convenience can mask risks: silent corruption, accidental deletion, ransomware, or compromised credentials can lead to rapid, irreversible data loss. Retention and version history help, but they’re not enough for compliance, audit, or long-term recovery. Without immutable, externalized backups, your files remain vulnerable to threats that propagate faster than you can react.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="-what-happens-when-onedrive-is-compromised">🔓 What happens when OneDrive is compromised?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If files are deleted locally, OneDrive syncs those deletions to the cloud sometimes before you notice. Ransomware or malware can encrypt files and sync the damage across all devices. A breach of your Microsoft account can expose or wipe entire libraries. Native recovery options are limited by retention windows and version history, which may not cover every scenario.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OpenDrive</title><link>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/opendrive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/opendrive/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="-why-protecting-opendrive-matters">🧠 Why protecting OpenDrive matters&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Relying solely on OpenDrive’s built-in sync and versioning exposes you to risks like silent corruption, accidental deletion, ransomware, or account compromise. Permanent data loss or compliance failures can occur if files are deleted or tampered with and no independent backup exists. Without robust, externalized backups, recovery options are limited and downtime can be costly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="-what-if-your-opendrive-is-deleted-or-compromised">🔓 What if your OpenDrive is deleted or compromised?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>OpenDrive’s native protections may not be enough if files are deleted, overwritten by malware, or accessed with leaked credentials. Permanent deletions or ransomware attacks can propagate quickly, leaving no clean copy to restore. Plakar mitigates these risks by:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Proton Drive</title><link>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/protondrive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/protondrive/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="-why-protecting-proton-drive-matters">🧠 Why protecting Proton Drive matters&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cloud sync and encryption protect privacy, but not against all risks. Files in Proton Drive can be lost to accidental deletion, overwritten by malware, or permanently removed after trash expiry. Account lockouts or credential loss can make data inaccessible, and compliance needs often require more than basic retention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Without immutable backups, recovery from these scenarios is unreliable or impossible.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="-what-happens-when-proton-drive-files-are-deleted-or-compromised">🔓 What happens when Proton Drive files are deleted or compromised?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If files are deleted intentionally or by mistake across synced devices, or if ransomware overwrites originals, Proton Drive’s native features may not help. Trash expiry or account suspension can make recovery impossible, and sync can propagate errors instantly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Filesystem</title><link>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/fs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/fs/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="why-protecting-your-filesystem-matters">Why protecting your Filesystem matters&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Most of us protect our files by simply copying them to an external drive or a USB stick. While having a second copy is a good start, it isn&amp;rsquo;t a real backup strategy. Standard file copying leaves your data vulnerable to a few common problems:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Accidental Deletion&lt;/strong>: If you delete a file by mistake and your sync tool mirrors that change, the file is gone from both places.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ransomware and Corruption&lt;/strong>: If your files are hit by malware or a disk failure, &amp;ldquo;copying&amp;rdquo; those files usually just preserves the damaged versions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Human Error&lt;/strong>: It is incredibly easy to overwrite a new version of a document with an old one during a manual move.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For your personal photos, system settings, or work projects, you need a way to go back to a specific version of your data that you know is safe and healthy in case of a mishap with your current data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>S3</title><link>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/s3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.plakar.io/integrations/s3/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="-why-protecting-s3-data-matters">🧠 Why protecting S3 data matters&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>S3 is often treated as the backup, but object storage is not immune to failure or abuse:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Objects can be overwritten or deleted instantly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Versioning is optional and easy to misconfigure&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Replication spreads corruption just as fast as good data&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lifecycle policies can silently delete critical objects&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In practice, S3 is highly durable but logically fragile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Human error, compromised credentials, buggy applications, or ransomware can destroy or encrypt entire buckets in seconds.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
