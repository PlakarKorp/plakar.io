&lt;p>A &lt;strong>filesystem&lt;/strong> organizes and stores data on a storage device in a hierarchical structure of files and directories. It handles operations such as reading, writing, access control, timestamps, and permissions. Local filesystems (e.g., ext4, APFS, NTFS) and mounted remote filesystems (e.g., NFS, SMB) are the foundation of most systems and are critical to safeguard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plakar leverages its &lt;strong>immutable snapshot engine&lt;/strong> to perform consistent, secure, and encrypted backups of filesystem trees. The Filesystem integration transforms the scanned directory structure into a verifiable virtual snapshot that can be restored anywhere, in part or in full.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>S3</title><link>https://www-v2.plakar.io/integrations/s3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www-v2.plakar.io/integrations/s3/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="what-is-s3">What is S3?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a highly available and durable object storage service used to store arbitrary data as discrete objects in buckets. S3 is offered by AWS, and compatible implementations are available via software such as MinIO, Ceph RGW, Wasabi, and Scality Zenko. It is ideal for storing backups, media archives, logs, and large data sets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With Plakar, you can ingest data from S3 buckets into immutable, encrypted snapshots that are verifiable and portable. You can also use S3 as a target repository to store backups created from any source.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
